# MariaDB MaxScale Notification Service and Feedback Support

## Overview

The purpose of Notification Service in MariaDB MaxScale is for a customer registered for the service to receive update notices, security bulletins, fixes and workarounds that are tailored to the database server configuration.

## MariaDB MaxScale Setup

MariaDB MaxScale may collect the installed plugins and send the information's nightly, between 2:00 AM and 4:59 AM.

It tries to send data and if there is any failure (timeout, server is down, etc), the next retry is in 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

This feature is not enabled by default: MariaDB MaxScale must be configured in `[feedback]` section:

```
[feedback]
feedback_enable=1
feedback_url=https://enterprise.mariadb.com/feedback/post
feedback_user_info=x-y-z-w
```

The activation code that will be provided by MariaDB Corporation Ab upon request by the customer and it should be put in feedback_user_info.

Example:
```
feedback_user_info=0467009f-b04d-45b1-a77b-b6b2ec9c6cf4
```

MariaDB MaxScale generates the feedback report containing following information:

 - The activation code used to enable feedback
 - MariaDB MaxScale Version
 - An identifier of the MariaDB MaxScale installation, i.e. the HEX encoding of SHA1 digest of the first network interface MAC address
 - Operating System (i.e Linux)
 - Operating System Distribution (i.e. CentOS release 6.5 (Final))
 - All the modules in use in MariaDB MaxScale and their API and version
 - MariaDB MaxScale server UNIX_TIME at generation time

MariaDB MaxScale shall send the generated feedback report to a feedback server specified in _feedback_url_.


## Manual Operation

If itâ€™s not possible to send data due to firewall or security settings the report could be generated manually (feedback_user_info is required) via MaxAdmin.

```
MaxScale>show feedbackreport
```

Report could be saved to report.txt file:

```
$ maxadmin show feedbackreport > ./report.txt

curl -F data=@./report.txt https://mariadb.org/feedback_plugin/post
```
