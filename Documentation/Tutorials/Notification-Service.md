## Overview

The purpose of Notification Service in MaxScale is for a customer registered for the service to receive update notices, security bulletins, fixes and workarounds that are tailored to the database server configuration.

## MaxScale Setup

MaxScale may collect the installed plugins and send the informations nightly, between 2:00 AM and 4:59 AM.

It tries to send data and if there is any failure (timeout, server is down, etc), the next retry is in 1800 seconds (30 minutes)

This feature is not enabled by default: MaxScale must be configured in [feedback] section:


	[feedback]
	feedback_enable=1
	feedback_url=https://enterprise.mariadb.com/feedback/post
	feedback_user_info=x-y-z-w

The activation code that will be provided by MariaDB corp upon request by the customer and it shlud be put in feedback_user_info.

Example:
feedback_user_info=0467009f-b04d-45b1-a77b-b6b2ec9c6cf4


MaxScale generates the feedback report containing following information:

 -The activation code used to enable feedback 
 - MaxScale Version
 - An identifier of the MaxScale installation, i.e. the HEX encoding of SHA1 digest of the first network interface MAC address
 - Operating System (i.e Linux)
 - Operating Suystem Distribution (i.e. CentOS release 6.5 (Final))
 - All the modules in use in MaxScale and their API and version
 - MaxScale server UNIX_TIME at generation time

MaxScale shall send the generated feedback report to a feedback server specified in feedback_url


## Manual Operation

If itâ€™s not possible to send data due to firewall or security settings the report could be generated manually (feedback_user_info is required) via MaxAdmin


MaxScale>show feedbackreport


Report could be saved to report.txt file:


maxadmin -uxxx -pyyy show feedbackreport > ./report.txt

curl -F data=@./report.txt https://mariadb.org/feedback_plugin/post
