# Connection Routing with MariaDB Replication

# Environment & Solution Space

The object of this tutorial is to have a system that has two ports available, one for write connections to the database cluster and the other for read connections to the database.

## Setting up MariaDB MaxScale

The first part of this tutorial is covered in [MariaDB MaxScale Tutorial](MaxScale-Tutorial.md). Please read it and follow the instructions for setting up MariaDB MaxScale with the type of cluster you want to use.

Once you have MariaDB MaxScale installed and the database users created, we can create the configuration file for MariaDB MaxScale.

## Creating Your MariaDB MaxScale Configuration

MariaDB MaxScale reads its configuration from `/etc/maxscale.cnf`. A template configuration is provided with the MaxScale installation.

A global, `[maxscale]`, section is included within every MariaDB MaxScale configuration file; this is used to set the values of various MariaDB MaxScale wide parameters, perhaps the most important of these is the number of threads that MariaDB MaxScale will use to handle client requests.

```
[maxscale]
threads=4
```

Since we are using MariaDB Replication and connection routing we want two different ports to which the client application can connect; one that will be directed to the current master within the replication cluster and another that will load balance between the slaves. To achieve this within MariaDB MaxScale we need to define two services in the ini file; one for the read/write operations that should be executed on the master server and another for connections to one of the slaves. Create a section for each in your MariaDB MaxScale configuration file and set the type to service, the section names are the names of the services themselves and should be meaningful to the administrator. Avoid using whitespace in the section names.

```
[Write-Service]
type=service

[Read-Service]
type=service

```
The router for these two sections is identical, the readconnroute module, also the services should be provided with the list of servers that will be part of the cluster. The server names given here are actually the names of server sections in the configuration file and not the physical hostnames or addresses of the servers.

```
[Write-Service]
type=service
router=readconnroute
servers=dbserv1, dbserv2, dbserv3

[Read-Service]
type=service
router=readconnroute
servers=dbserv1, dbserv2, dbserv3
```

In order to instruct the router to which servers it should route we must add router options to the service. The router options are compared to the status that the monitor collects from the servers and used to restrict the eligible set of servers to which that service may route. In our case we use the two options master and slave for our two services.

```
[Write-Service]
type=service
router=readconnroute
router_options=master
servers=dbserv1, dbserv2, dbserv3

[Read-Service]
type=service
router=readconnroute
router_options=slave
servers=dbserv1, dbserv2, dbserv3
```

The final step in the service sections is to add the username and password that will be used to populate the user data from the database cluster. There are two options for representing the password, either plain text or encrypted passwords may be used. In order to use encrypted passwords a set of keys must be generated that will be used by the encryption and decryption process. To generate the keys use the maxkeys command and pass the name of the secrets file in which the keys are stored.

```
maxkeys /var/lib/maxscale/.secrets
```

Once the keys have been created the maxpasswd command can be used to generate the encrypted password.

```
maxpasswd plainpassword
96F99AA1315BDC3604B006F427DD9484
```

The username and password, either encrypted or plain text, are stored in the service section using the user and passwd parameters.

```
[Write-Service]
type=service
router=readconnroute
router_options=master
servers=dbserv1, dbserv2, dbserv3
user=maxscale
passwd=96F99AA1315BDC3604B006F427DD9484

[Read-Service]
type=service
router=readconnroute
router_options=slave
servers=dbserv1, dbserv2, dbserv3
user=maxscale
passwd=96F99AA1315BDC3604B006F427DD9484
```

This completes the definitions required by the services, however listening ports must be associated with the services in order to allow network connections. This is done by creating a series of listener sections. These sections again are named for the convenience of the administrator and should be of type listener with an entry labeled service which contains the name of the service to associate the listener with. Each service may have multiple listeners.

```
[Write-Listener]
type=listener
service=Write-Service

[Read-Listener]
type=listener
service=Read-Service
```

A listener must also define the protocol module it will use for the incoming network protocol, currently this should be the MySQLClient protocol for all database listeners. The listener may then supply a network port to listen on and/or a socket within the file system.

```
[Write-Listener]
type=listener
service=Write-Service
protocol=MySQLClient
port=4306
socket=/tmp/ClusterMaster

[Read-Listener]
type=listener
service=Read-Service
protocol=MySQLClient
port=4307
```

An address parameter may be given if the listener is required to bind to a particular network address when using hosts with multiple network addresses. The default behavior is to listen on all network interfaces.

The next stage is the configuration is to define the server information. This defines how to connect to each of the servers within the cluster, again a section is created for each server, with the type set to server, the network address and port to connect to and the protocol to use to connect to the server. Currently the protocol for all database connections in MySQLBackend.

```
[dbserv1]
type=server
address=192.168.2.1
port=3306
protocol=MySQLBackend

[dbserv2]
type=server
address=192.168.2.2
port=3306
protocol=MySQLBackend

[dbserv3]
type=server
address=192.168.2.3
port=3306
protocol=MySQLBackend
```

In order for MariaDB MaxScale to monitor the servers using the correct monitoring mechanisms a section should be provided that defines the monitor to use and the servers to monitor. Once again a section is created with a symbolic name for the monitor, with the type set to monitor. Parameters are added for the module to use, the list of servers to monitor and the username and password to use when connecting to the the servers with the monitor.

```
[Replication-Monitor]
type=monitor
module=mysqlmon
servers=dbserv1, dbserv2, dbserv3
user=maxscale
passwd=96F99AA1315BDC3604B006F427DD9484
monitor_interval=10000
```

As with the password definition in the server either plain text or encrypted passwords may be used.

The final stage in the configuration is to add the option service which is used by the maxadmin command to connect to MariaDB MaxScale for monitoring and administration purposes. This creates a service section and a listener section.

```
[CLI]
type=service
router=cli

[CLI-Listener]
type=listener
service=CLI
protocol=maxscaled
socket=default
```

# Starting MariaDB MaxScale

Upon completion of the configuration process MariaDB MaxScale is ready to be started for the first time. This may either be done manually by running the maxscale command or via the service interface.

```
maxscale
```

or

```
service maxscale start
```

Check the error log in /var/log/maxscale/ to see if any errors are detected in the configuration file and to confirm MariaDB MaxScale has been started. Also the maxadmin command may be used to confirm that MariaDB MaxScale is running and the services, listeners etc have been correctly configured.

```

```

MariaDB MaxScale is now ready to start accepting client connections and routing them to the master or slaves within your cluster. Other configuration options are available that can alter the criteria used for routing, these include monitoring the replication lag within the cluster and routing only to slaves that are within a predetermined delay from the current master or using weights to obtain unequal balancing operations. These options may be found in the MariaDB MaxScale Configuration Guide.

More detail on the use of maxadmin can be found in the document [MaxAdmin - The MariaDB MaxScale Administration & Monitoring Client Application](Administration-Tutorial.md).
