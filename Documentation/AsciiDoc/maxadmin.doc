MaxAdmin - The MaxScale Administrative & Monitoring Client Application
======================================================================

Overview
--------

MaxAdmin is a simple client interface that can be used to interact with the 
MaxScale server, it allows the display of internal MaxScale statistics, 
status and control of MaxScale operations. 
 
MaxAdmin supports 

* Interactive user sessions 
* Execution of one-off commands via command line arguments 
* Execution of command scripts 

Running MaxAdmin
----------------

The MaxAdmin client application may be run in two different modes, either as 
an interactive command shell for executing commands against MaxScale or by 
passing commands on the MaxAdmin command line itself. 

Command Line Switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MaxAdmin command accepts a number of switches 
 
+-u+ 'user'::
+--user=+'user'::

  Sets the username that will be used for the MaxScale connection. If
  no -u option is passed on the MaxAdmin command line then the 
  default username of ‘admin’ will be used. 

+-p+ 'password'::
+--password=+'password'::

  Sets the user password that will be used. If no -p option is passed 
  on the command line then MaxAdmin will prompt for interactive 
  entry of the password. 

+-h+ 'hostname'::
+--host=+'hostname'::

  The hostname of the MaxScale server to connect to. If no -h option 
  is passed on the command line then MaxAdmin will attempt to 
  connect to the host ‘localhost’. 

+-P+ 'port'::
+--port=+'port'::

  The port that MaxAdmin will use to connect to the MaxScale server.
  if no -P option is given then the default port of 6603 will be used. 

+-v+::
+--version+::
  
  Print MaxAdmin version information
  
+-h+::
+--help+:: 

  Print usage information regarding MaxAdmin 

When a switch takes a value, this may either be as the next argument on the 
command line or maybe as part of the switch itself. E.g. +-u me+ and +-ume+ 
are treated in the same way. 

Interactive Operation
---------------------

If no arguments other than the command line switches are passed to MaxAdmin 
it will enter its interactive mode of operation. Users will be prompted to 
enter commands with a "MaxScale>" prompt. The commands themselves are 
documented in the sections later in this document. A help system is available
that will give some minimal details of the commands available. 
 
Command history is available on platforms that support the libedit library. 
This allows the use of the up and down arrow keys to recall previous commands
that have been executed by MaxAdmin. The default edit mode for the history 
is to emulate the vi commands, the behaviour of libedit may however be 
customised using the .editrc file. To obtain the history of commands that 
have been executed use the inbuilt history command. 
 
In interactive mode it is possible to execute a set of commands stored in an 
external file by using the source command. The command takes the argument of 
a filename which should contain a set of MaxScale commands, one per line. 
These will be executed in the order they appear in the file. 

Command Line Operation
----------------------

MaxAdmin can also be used to execute commands that are passed on the command 
line, e.g.:
 
  $ maxadmin -hmaxscale list services 
  Password:  
  Services. 
  --------------------------+----------------------+--------+--------------- 
  Service Name              | Router Module        | #Users | Total Sessions 
  --------------------------+----------------------+--------+--------------- 
  Test Service              | readconnroute        |      1 |     1 
  Split Service             | readwritesplit       |      1 |     1 
  Filter Service            | readconnroute        |      1 |     1 
  QLA Service               | readconnroute        |      1 |     1 
  Debug Service             | debugcli             |      1 |     1 
  CLI                       | cli                  |      2 |    27 
  --------------------------+----------------------+--------+--------------- 
 
 
The single command is executed and MaxAdmin then terminates. If the -p 
option is not given then MaxAdmin will prompt for a password. If a MaxScale 
command requires an argument which contains whitespace, for example a service
name, that name should be quoted. The quotes will be preserved and used in 
the execution of the MaxScale command. 
 
  $ maxadmin show service "QLA Service" 
  Password:  
  Service 0x70c6a0 
          Service: QLA Service 
          Router: readconnroute (0x7ffff0f7ae60)

          Current no. of router sessions: 0 
          Number of queries forwarded: 0

Command files may be executed by either calling MaxAdmin with the name of 
the file that contains the commands 
 
  maxadmin listall.ms 

 
Or by using the #! mechanism to make the command file executable from the 
shell. To do this add a line at the start of your command file that contains 
the #! directive with the path of the MaxAdmin executable. Command options 
may also be given in this line. For example to create a script file that
runs a set of list commands 
 
  #!/usr/local/bin/maxadmin -hmaxscalehost 
  list modules 
  list servers 
  list services 
  list listeners 
  list dcbs 
  list sessions 
  list filters 

Then simply set this file to have execute permissions and it may be run like 
any other command in the Linux shell. 

Getting Help
------------

A help system is available that describes the commands available via the 
administration interface. To obtain a list of all commands available simply 
type the command help. 
 
  MaxScale> help 
  Available commands: 
    add user 
    clear server 
    disable [heartbeat|log|root] 
    enable [heartbeat|log|root] 
    list [clients|dcbs|filters|listeners|modules|monitors|services|servers|sessions] 
    reload [config|dbusers] 
    remove user 
    restart [monitor|service] 
    set server 
    show [dcbs|dcb|dbusers|epoll|filter|filters|modules|monitor|monitors|server|servers|services|service|session|sessions|users] 
    shutdown [maxscale|monitor|service] 
 
Type help command to see details of each command. 
Where commands require names as arguments and these names contain 
whitespace either the \ character may be used to escape the whitespace 
or the name may be enclosed in double quotes ". 
 
  MaxScale>  

To see more detail on a particular command, and a list of the sub commands 
of the command, type help followed by the command name. 
 
  MaxScale> help list 
  Available options to the list command: 
    clients    List all the client connections to MaxScale 
    dcbs       List all the DCBs active within MaxScale 
    filters    List all the filters defined within MaxScale 
    listeners  List all the listeners defined within MaxScale 
    modules    List all currently loaded modules 
    monitors   List all monitors 
    services   List all the services defined within MaxScale 
    servers    List all the servers defined within MaxScale 
    sessions   List all the active sessions within MaxScale 

 
Working With Services
---------------------

A service is a very important concept in MaxScale as it defines the mechanism
by which clients interact with MaxScale and can attached to the backend 
databases. A number of commands exist that allow interaction with the
services. 

What Services Are Available?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list services command can be used to discover what services are currently available within your MaxScale configuration. 
 
  MaxScale> list services 
  Services. 
  --------------------------+----------------------+--------+--------------- 
  Service Name              | Router Module        | #Users | Total Sessions 
  --------------------------+----------------------+--------+--------------- 
  Test Service              | readconnroute        |      1 |     1  
  Split Service             | readwritesplit       |      1 |     1 
  Filter Service            | readconnroute        |      1 |     1 
  QLA Service               | readconnroute        |      1 |     1 
  Debug Service             | debugcli             |      1 |     1 
  CLI                       | cli                  |      2 |    24 
  --------------------------+----------------------+--------+--------------- 
 
In order to determine which ports services are using then the list listeners 
command can be used. 
 
  MaxScale> list listeners 
  Listeners. 
  ---------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------+-------- 
  Service Name         | Protocol Module    | Address         | Port  | State  
  ---------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------+-------- 
  Test Service         | MySQLClient        | *               |  4006 | Running 
  Split Service        | MySQLClient        | *               |  4007 | Running 
  Filter Service       | MySQLClient        | *               |  4008 | Running 
  QLA Service          | MySQLClient        | *               |  4009 | Running 
  Debug Service        | telnetd            | localhost       |  4242 | Running 
  CLI                  | maxscaled          | localhost       |  6603 | Running 
  ---------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------+-------- 
 
See Service Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to see the details of an individual service using the show 
service command. This command should be passed the name of the service you 
wish to examine as an argument. 

Where a service name contains spaces characters there should either be 
escaped or the name placed in quotes. 
 
  MaxScale> show service "QLA Service" 
  Service 0x70c6a0 
  Service: QLA Service 
  Router: readconnroute (0x7ffff0f7ae60) 
  Number of router sessions: 0 
  Current no. of router sessions: 0 
  Number of queries forwarded: 0 
  Started: Wed Jun 25 10:08:23 2014 
  Backend databases 
          127.0.0.1:3309  Protocol: MySQLBackend 
          127.0.0.1:3308  Protocol: MySQLBackend 
          127.0.0.1:3307  Protocol: MySQLBackend 
          127.0.0.1:3306  Protocol: MySQLBackend 
  Users data: 0x724340 
  Total connections: 1 
  Currently connected: 1 
 
This allows the set of backend servers defined by the service to be seen 
along with the service statistics and other information. 

Examining Service Users
-----------------------

MaxScale provides an authentication model by which the client application 
authenticates with MaxScale using the credentials they would normally use 
to with the database itself. MaxScale loads the user data from one of the
backend databases defined for the service. The show dbusers command can be 
used to examine the user data held by MaxScale. 
 
  MaxScale> show dbusers "Filter Service" 
  Users table data 
  Hashtable: 0x723e50, size 52 
             No. of entries: 48

  daka@%, nuovo@127.0.0.1, uno@127.0.0.1, repluser@192.168.56.1, havoc@%, 
  tekka@192.168.1.19, due@192.168.56.1, qwerty@127.0.0.1, massimiliano@%, 
  massi@%, massim@% 

Reloading Service User Data
---------------------------

MaxScale will automatically reload user data if there are failed 
authentication requests from client applications. This reloading is rate 
limited and triggered by missing entries in the MaxScale table. If a user is 
removed from the backend database user table it will not trigger removal 
from the MaxScale internal table. The reload dbusers command can be used to 
force the reloading of the user table within MaxScale. 
 
  MaxScale> reload dbusers "Split Service" 
  Loaded 34 database users for service Split Service. 

 
Stopping A Service
------------------

It is possible to stop a service from accepting new connections by using the 
shutdown service command. This will not affect the connections that are 
already in place for a service, but will stop any new connections from being 
accepted. 
 
  MaxScale> shutdown service "Split Service" 

Restart A Stopped Service
-------------------------

A stopped service may be restarted by using the restart service command. 
 
  MaxScale> restart service "Split Service" 


Working With Servers
--------------------

The server represents each of the instances of MySQL or MariaDB that a 
service may use.  

What Servers Are Configured?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command list servers can be used to display a list of all the servers 
configured within MaxScale. 
 
  MaxScale> list servers 
  Servers. 
  -------------------+-----------------+-------+----------------------+------------ 
  Server             | Address         | Port  | Status               | Connections

  -------------------+-----------------+-------+----------------------+------------ 
 
Server Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to see more details regarding a given server using the show 
server command. 
 
  MaxScale> show server server2 
  Server 0x70d460 (server2) 
  Server:                   127.0.0.1 
  Status:                   Master, Running 
  Protocol:                 MySQLBackend
  Port:                     3307
  Server Version:           5.5.25-MariaDB-log
  Node Id:                  124
  Number of connections:    0
  Current no. of conns:     0

Setting The State Of A Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MaxScale maintains a number of status bits for each server that is 
configured, these status bits are normally maintained by the monitors, 
there are two commands in the user interface that are used to manually 
maintain these bits also; the set server and clear server commands. 
 
The status bit that can be controlled are 

running:: 

  The server is responding to requests, accepting connections and 
  executing database commands 

master::

  The server is a master in a replication setup or should be 
  considered as a destination for database updates. 

slave::

  The server is a replication slave or is considered as a read only 
  database. 

synced::

  The server is a fully fledged member of a Galera cluster 

maintenance::

  The server is in maintenance mode. In this mode no new 
  connections will be established to the server. The monitors will 
  also not monitor servers that are in maintenance mode. 

All status bits, with the exception of the maintenance bit, will be set by 
the monitors that are monitoring the server. If manual control is required 
the monitor should be stopped. 
 
  MaxScale> set server server3 maintenance 
  MaxScale> clear server server3 maintenance 


Working With Sessions
---------------------

The MaxScale session represents the state within MaxScale. Sessions are 
dynamic entities and not named in the configuration file, this means that 
sessions can not be easily named within the user interface. The sessions are 
referenced using ID values, these are actually memory address, however the 
important thing is that no two session have the same ID. 

What Sessions Are Active in MaxScale?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of ways to find out what sessions are active, the most 
comprehensive being the list sessions command. 
 
  MaxScale> list sessions 
  Sessions. 
  -----------------+-----------------+----------------+-------------------------- 
  Session          | Client          | Service        | State 
  -----------------+-----------------+----------------+-------------------------- 
  0x7267a0         | 127.0.0.1       | CLI            | Session ready for routing 
  0x726340         |                 | CLI            | Listener Session 
  0x725720         |                 | Debug Service  | Listener Session 
  0x724720         |                 | QLA Service    | Listener Session 
  0x72a750         |                 | Filter Service | Listener Session 
  0x709500         |                 | Split Service  | Listener Session 
  0x7092d0         |                 | Test Service   | Listener Session 
  -----------------+-----------------+----------------+-------------------------- 


This lists all the sessions for both user connections and for the service 
listeners. 
 
The list clients command will give just the subset of sessions that 
originate from a client connection. 
 
  MaxScale> list clients 
  Client Connections 
  -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------ 
   Client          | DCB        | Service              | Session 
  -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------ 
   127.0.0.1       |   0x7274b0 | CLI                  |   0x727700 
   127.0.0.1       |   0x727900 | QLA Service          |   0x727da0 
  -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------ 
 
Display Session Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the session ID has been determined using one of the above method it is 
possible to determine more detail regarding a session by using the show 
session command. 
 
  MaxScale> show session 0x727da0 
  Session 0x727da0 
          State:                Session ready for routing 
          Service:              QLA Service (0x70d6a0) 
          Client DCB:           0x727900 
          Client Address:       127.0.0.1 
          Connected:            Wed Jun 25 15:27:21 2014 


Descriptor Control Blocks
-------------------------

The Descriptor Control Block or DCB is a very important entity within 
MaxScale, it represents the state of each connection within MaxScale. 
A DCB is allocated for every connection from a client, every network 
listener and every connection to a backend database. Statistics for 
each of these connections are maintained within these DCB’s. 
 
As with session above the DCB’s are not named and are therefore referred 
to by the use of a unique ID, the memory address of the DCB. 

Finding DCB’s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to determine what DCB’s are active within a MaxScale 
server, the most straightforward being the list dcbs command. 
 
  MaxScale> list dcbs 
  Descriptor Control Blocks 
  ------------+----------------------------+----------------------+---------- 
   DCB        | State                      | Service              | Remote 
  ------------+----------------------------+----------------------+---------- 
     0x667170 | DCB for listening socket   | Test Service         |  
     0x71a350 | DCB for listening socket   | Split Service        |  
     0x724b40 | DCB for listening socket   | Filter Service       |  
     0x7250d0 | DCB for listening socket   | QLA Service          |  
     0x725740 | DCB for listening socket   | Debug Service        |  
     0x726740 | DCB for listening socket   | CLI                  |  
     0x7274b0 | DCB in the polling loop    | CLI                  | 127.0.0.1 
     0x727900 | DCB in the polling loop    | QLA Service          | 127.0.0.1 
     0x72e880 | DCB in the polling loop    | QLA Service          |  
  ------------+----------------------------+----------------------+---------- 

A MaxScale server that has activity on it will however have many more DCB’s 
than in the example above, making it hard to find the DCB that you require. 
The DCB ID is also included in a number of other command outputs, depending 
on the information you have it may be easier to use other methods to locate 
a particular DCB. 

DCB Of A Client Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find the DCB for a particular client connection it may be best to start 
with the list clients command and then look at each DCB for a particular 
client address to determine the one of interest. 

DCB Details
~~~~~~~~~~~

The details of an individual DCB can be obtained by use of the show dcb 
command 
 
  MaxScale> show dcb 0x727900 
  DCB: 0x727900 
       DCB state:       DCB in the polling loop 
       Connected to:    127.0.0.1 
       Owning Session:  0x727da0 
       Statistics:
                No. of Reads:                   4 
                No. of Writes:                  3   
                No. of Buffered Writes:         0 
                No. of Accepts:                 0 
                No. of High Water Events:       0 
                No. of Low Water Events:        0 

Working with Filters
--------------------

Filters allow the request contents and result sets from a database to be 
modified for a client connection, pipelines of filters can be created between
the client connection and MaxScale router modules. 

What Filters Are Configured?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filters are configured in the configuration file for MaxScale, they are 
given names and may be included in the definition of a service. The list 
filters command can be used to determine which filters are defined. 
 
  MaxScale> list filters 
  Filters 
  --------------------+-----------------+---------------------------------------- 
  Filter              | Module          | Options

Retrieve Details Of A Filter Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command show filter can be used to display information related to a 
particular filter. 
 
  MaxScale> show filter QLA 
  Filter 0x719460 (QLA) 
         Module:        qlafilter 
         Options:       /tmp/QueryLog   
               Limit logging to connections from 127.0.0.1 
               Include queries that match    select.*from.*user.*where 

Filter Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The show session command will include details for each of the filters in use 
within a session. First use list sessions or list clients to find the session
of interest and then run the show session command.
 
  MaxScale> list clients 
  Client Connections 
  -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------ 
   Client          | DCB        | Service              | Session 
  -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------ 
   127.0.0.1       |   0x7361a0 | Split Service        |   0x736680 
   127.0.0.1       |   0x737ec0 | Plumbing             |   0x7382b0 
   127.0.0.1       |   0x73ab20 | DigitalOcean         |   0x73ad90 
   127.0.0.1       |   0x7219e0 | CLI                  |   0x721bd0 
  -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------

  MaxScale> show session 0x736680

          State:                Session ready for routing 
          Service:              Split Service (0x719f60) 
          Client DCB:           0x7361a0 
          Client Address:       127.0.0.1 
          Connected:            Thu Jun 26 10:10:44 2014 
          Filter: top10 
                Report size     10 
                Logging to file /tmp/Query.top10.1. 
                Current Top 10:  
                1 place:
                        Execution time: 23.826 seconds
                        SQL: select sum(salary), year(from_date) from salaries s,
  (select distinct year(from_date) as y1 from salaries) y where (makedate(y.y1, 1)
  between s.from_date and s.to_date) group by y.y1 ("1988--08--01?
                 2 place:
                 [...]
                 10 place:
                          Execution time: 0.169 seconds
                          SQL: select year(hire_date) -- year(birth_date) as "Age",
  count(*) as Count from employees group by year(hire_date) -- year(birth_date) order by 1

The data displayed varies from filter to filter, the example above is the 
top filter. This filter prints a report of the current top queries at the 
time the show session command is run. 


Working With Monitors
---------------------

Monitors are used to monitor the state of databases within MaxScale in 
order to supply information to other modules, specifically the routers 
within MaxScale. 

What Monitors Are Running?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see what monitors are running within MaxScale use the list monitors 
command. 
 
  MaxScale> list monitors 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 
  | Monitor              | Status 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 
  | MySQL Monitor        | Running 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 

Details Of A Particular Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see the details of a particular monitor use the show monitor command. 
 
  MaxScale> show monitor "MySQL Monitor" 
  Monitor: 0x71c370 
         Name:                  MySQL Monitor 
         Monitor running 
         Sampling interval:     10000 milliseconds 
         MaxScale MonitorId:    24209641 
         Replication lag:       disabled 
         Monitored servers:     127.0.0.1:3306, 127.0.0.1:3307, 127.0.0.1:3308, 127.0.0.1:3309 

Controlling Replication Heartbeat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some monitors provide a replication heartbeat mechanism that monitors the 
delay for data that is replicated from a master to slaves in a tree 
structured replication environment. This can be enabled or disabled using 
the commands enable heartbeat and disable heartbeat. 
 
  MaxScale> disable heartbeat "MySQL Monitor" 
  MaxScale> enable heartbeat "MySQL Monitor" 

Please note that changes made via this interface will not persist across 
restarts of MaxScale. To make a permanent change edit the MaxScale.cnf file. 
 
Enabling the replication heartbeat mechanism will add the display of 
heartbeat information in the show server output:

  MaxScale> show server server4 
  Server 0x719800 (server4) 
         Server:                    127.0.0.1

         Number of connections:     0 
         Current no. of conns:      0


Shutting Down A Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A monitor may be shutdown using the shutdown monitor command. This allows 
for manual control of the status of servers using the set server and clear 
server commands.  
 
  MaxScale> shutdown monitor "MySQL Monitor" 

  MaxScale> list monitors 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 
  | Monitor              | Status 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 
  | MySQL Monitor        | Stopped 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 

 

Restarting A Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A monitor that has been shutdown may be restarted using the restart monitor 
command. 
 
  MaxScale> restart monitor "MySQL Monitor" 

  MaxScale> list monitors 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 
  | Monitor              | Status 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 
  | MySQL Monitor        | Running 
  +----------------------+--------------------- 


Working With Administration Interface Users
-------------------------------------------

A default installation of MaxScale allows connection to the administration 
interface using the username of admin and the password skysql. This username 
and password stay in effect as long as no other users have been created for 
the administration interface. As soon as the first user is added the use of 
admin/skysql as login credentials will be disabled. 

What Users Have Been Defined?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to see the current users that have been defined for the 
administration interface use the command show users. 
 
  MaxScale> show users 
  Administration interface users: 
  Users table data 
  Hashtable: 0x734470, size 52 
             No. of entries:         5 
             Average chain length:   0.1 
             Longest chain length:   2 
  User names: vilho, root, dba, massi, mark 

 
Please note that if no users have been configured the default admin/skysql 
user will not be shown. 
 
  MaxScale> show users 
  Administration interface users: 
  No administration users have been defined. 

Add A New User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new administrative user to the MaxScale server use the command add 
user. This command is passed a user name and a password. 
 
  MaxScale> add user maria dtbse243 
  User maria has been successfully added. 

Delete A User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a user the command remove user is used, it must also be called 
with the username and password of the user. The password will be checked. 
 
  MaxScale> remove user maria des 
  Failed to remove user maria. Authentication failed 

  MaxScale> remove user maria dtbse243 
  User maria has been successfully removed. 



Administration Commands
-----------------------

What Modules Are In use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to determine what modules are in use, and the version and status of 
those modules the list modules command can be used. 
 
  MaxScale> list modules 
  Modules. 
  ----------------+-------------+---------+-------+------------------------- 
  Module Name     | Module Type | Version | API   | Status 
  ----------------+-------------+---------+-------+------------------------- 
  tee             | Filter      | V1.0.0  | 1.1.0 | Alpha 
  qlafilter       | Filter      | V1.1.1  | 1.1.0 | Alpha 
  topfilter       | Filter      | V1.0.1  | 1.1.0 | Alpha 
  MySQLBackend    | Protocol    | V2.0.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  maxscaled       | Protocol    | V1.0.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  telnetd         | Protocol    | V1.0.1  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  MySQLClient     | Protocol    | V1.0.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  mysqlmon        | Monitor     | V1.2.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  readconnroute   | Router      | V1.0.2  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  readwritesplit  | Router      | V1.0.2  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  debugcli        | Router      | V1.1.1  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  cli             | Router      | V1.0.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha 
  ----------------+-------------+---------+-------+------------------------- 
 

This command provides important version information for the module. Each 
module has two versions:

* the version of the module itself 
* the version of the module API that it supports. 

Also included in the output is the status of the module, this may be 
“In Development”, “Alpha”, “Beta”, “GA” or “Experimental”. 

Change MaxScale Logging Options
-------------------------------

Two commands are provided to change the logging levels within MaxScale, 
disable log and enable log. Using these commands the various log levels can 
be turned on and off, the supported levels are trace, debug and message. 
The error log level can not be turned off. 
 
  MaxScale> enable log trace 
  MaxScale> disable log debug 
 
Please note that changes made via this interface will not persist across 
restarts of MaxScale. To make a permanent change edit the MaxScale.cnf file. 

Reloading The Configuration
---------------------------

A command, reload config, is available that will cause MaxScale to reload 
the MaxScale.cnf configuration file. 

Shutting Down MaxScale
----------------------

The MaxScale server may be shutdown using the shutdown maxscale command. 
 
 

Configuring MaxScale to Accept MaxAdmin Connections
---------------------------------------------------

In order to allow the use of the MaxAdmin client interface the service must 
be added to the MaxScale.cnf file of the Maxscale server. The CLI service 
itself must be added and a listener for the maxscaled protocol. 
 
The default entries required are shown below. 
 
  [CLI] 
  type=service 
  router=cli 
 
  [CLI Listener] 
  type=listener 
  service=CLI 
  protocol=maxscaled 
  address=localhost 
  port=6603 

Note that this uses the default port of 6603 and confines the connections 
to localhost connections only. Remove the address= entry to allow 
connections from any machine on your network. Changing the port from 6603 
will mean that you must allows pass a -p option to the MaxAdmin command.
