MaxScale 0.6.0 Alpha
--------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

A number of bug fixes have been applied between the 0.5 alpha and this alpha release. The table below lists the bugs that have been resolved. The details for each of these may be found in bugs.skysql.com.

===== 423 =====

The new parameter “version_string” parameter has been added to 
service section. This allows a specific version string to be set 
for each service, this version string is used in the MySQL handshake 
from MaxScale to clients and is reported as the server version to 
clients. The version_string is optional, the default value will be 
taken from the embedded MariaDB library which supplies the parser to MaxScale.

===== 418 =====

Statements are not routed to master if a transaction is started implicitly 
by setting autocommit=0. In such cases statements were previously routed as 
if they were not part of a transaction.

This fix changes the behavior so that is autocommit is disabled, all 
statements are routed to the master and in case of session variable updates, 
to both master and slave.

Same defect caused that transaction and autocommit settings were visible in
subsequent client sessions. This has been fixed.
