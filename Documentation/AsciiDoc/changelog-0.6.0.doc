MaxScale 0.6.0 Alpha
--------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

A number of bug fixes have been applied between the 0.5 alpha and this alpha release. The table below lists the bugs that have been resolved. The details for each of these may be found in bugs.skysql.com.

* bug:418 Statements are not routed to master if a transaction is started 
  implicitly by setting autocommit=0. In such cases statements were previously 
  routed as if they were not part of a transaction.
  This fix changes the behavior so that is autocommit is disabled, all 
  statements are routed to the master and in case of session variable updates, 
  to both master and slave.
  Same defect caused that transaction and autocommit settings were visible in
  subsequent client sessions. This has been fixed.

* bug:423 The new parameter “version_string” parameter has been added to 
  service section. This allows a specific version string to be set 
  for each service, this version string is used in the MySQL handshake 
  from MaxScale to clients and is reported as the server version to 
  clients. The version_string is optional, the default value will be 
  taken from the embedded MariaDB library which supplies the parser to MaxScale.
