MaxScale 1.0.1 Beta
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

CMake build system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building MaxScale is now easier than ever thanks to the introduction of CMake 
into the build process. Building with CMake removes the need to edit files, 
specify directory locations or change build flags, in all but the rarest of 
the cases, and building with non-standard configurations is a lot easier 
thanks to the easy configuration of all the build parameters. 

Here’s a short list of the most common build parameters, their functions and 
default values.
