# PAM Authenticator

[TOC]

Pluggable authentication module (PAM) is a general purpose authentication API.
An application using PAM can authenticate a user without knowledge about the
underlying authentication implementation. The actual authentication scheme is
defined in the operating system PAM config (e.g. `/etc/pam.d/`), and can be
quite elaborate. MaxScale supports a very limited form of the PAM protocol,
which this document details.

## Configuration

The MaxScale PAM module requires little configuration. All that is required
is to change the listener authenticator module to "PAMAuth".

```
[Read-Write-Listener]
type=listener
address=::
service=Read-Write-Service
authenticator=PAMAuth

[Primary-Server]
type=server
address=123.456.789.10
port=12345
```

MaxScale uses the PAM authenticator plugin to authenticate users with *plugin*
set to "pam" in the *mysql.user*-table. The PAM service name of a user is read
from the *authentication_string*-column. The matching PAM service in the
operating system PAM config is used for authenticating the user. If the
*authentication_string* for a user is empty, the fallback service "mysql" is
used.

PAM service configuration is out of the scope of this document, see
[The Linux-PAM System Administrators' Guide](http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_SAG.html)
for more information. A simple service definition used for testing this module
is below.

```
auth            required        pam_unix.so
account         required        pam_unix.so
```

### `pam_use_cleartext_plugin`

Boolean, default value is "false". If enabled, MaxScale communicates with the
client as if using
[mysql_clear_password](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/connection/#mysql_clear_password-plugin).
This setting has no effect on MaxScale-to-backend communication, which adapts to
either "dialog" or "mysql_clear_password", depeding on which one the backend
suggests. This setting is meant to be used with the similarly named MariaDB
Server setting.

```
authenticator_options=pam_use_cleartext_plugin=1
```

### `pam_mode`

This setting defines the authentication mode used. The following values are
supported:

- `password` (default) Normal password-based authentication
- `password_2FA` Password + 2FA-code based authentication
- `suid` Authenticate using suid sandbox subprocess

```
authenticator_options=pam_mode=password_2FA
```

If set to *password_2FA*, any users authenticating via PAM will be asked two
passwords ("Password" and "Verification code") during login. MaxScale uses the
normal password when either the local PAM api or a backend asks for "Password".
MaxScale answers any other password prompt (e.g. "Verification code") with the
second password. See
[the limitations section](#implementation-details-and-limitations)
for more details. Two-factor mode is incompatible with
*pam_use_cleartext_plugin*.

If set to *suid*, MaxScale will launch a separate subprocess for every client to
handle pam authentication. This subprocess runs the binary
`maxscale_pam_auth_tool` (installed in the binary directory), which calls the
system pam libraries. The binary is installed with the SUID bit set, which means
that it runs with root-privileges regardless of the user launching it. This
should bypass any file grant issues (e.g. reading `etc/shadow`) that may arise
with the *password* or *password_2FA* options. The *suid*-option may also
perform faster if many clients authenticate with pam simultaneously due
to better separation of clients.  It may also resist buggy pam plugins crashing,
as the crash would be limited to the subprocess only. The MariaDB Server uses
a similar pam authentication scheme. *suid*-mode supports two-factor
authentication.

### `pam_backend_mapping`

Defines backend authentication mapping, i.e. switch of authentication method
between client-to-MaxScale and MaxScale-to-backend. Supported values:

- `none` (default) No mapping
- `mariadb` Map users to normal MariaDB accounts

```
authenticator_options=pam_backend_mapping=mariadb
```

If set to "mariadb", MaxScale will authenticate clients to backends using
standard MariaDB authentication. Authentication to MaxScale itself still uses
PAM. MaxScale asks the local PAM system if the client username was mapped
to another username during authentication, and use the mapped username when
logging in to backends. Passwords for the mapped users can be given in a file,
see `pam_mapped_pw_file` below. If passwords are not given, MaxScale will try to
authenticate without a password. Because of this, normal PAM users and mapped
users cannot be used on the same listener.

Because the client still needs to authenticate to MaxScale normally, an
anonymous user may be required. If the backends do not allow such a user, one
can be manually added using the service setting
[user_accounts_file](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#user_accounts_file).

To map usernames, the PAM service needs to use a module such as
*pam_user_map.so*. This module is not a standard Linux component and needs to be
installed separately. It is included in recent MariaDB Server packages and can
also be compiled from source. See
[user mapping](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/user-and-group-mapping-with-pam/)
for more information on how to configure the module. If the goal is to only map
users from PAM to MariaDB in MaxScale, then configuring user mapping
on just the machine running MaxScale is enough.

Instead of using `pam_backend_mapping`, consider using the listener setting
[user_mapping_file](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#user_mapping_file),
as it is easier to configure. `pam_backend_mapping` should only be used when
the user mapping needs to be defined by pam.

### `pam_mapped_pw_file`

Path to a json-text file with user passwords. Default value is empty, which
disables the feature.
```
authenticator_options=pam_mapped_pw_file=/home/root/passwords.json,pam_backend_mapping=mariadb
```
This feature only works together with `pam_backend_mapping=mariadb`. The file is
only read during listener creation (typically MaxScale start) or when a listener
is modified during runtime. The file should contain passwords for the mapped
users. When a client is authenticating, MaxScale searches the password data for a
matching username. If one is found, MaxScale uses the supplied password when
logging in to backends. Otherwise, MaxScale tries to authenticate without a
password.

One array, "users_and_passwords", is read from the file. Each array element in the array must define the following fields:
- "user": String. Mapped client username.
- "password": String. Backend server password. Can be encrypted with *maxpasswd*.

An example file is below.
```
{
    "users_and_passwords": [
        {
            "user": "my_mapped_user1",
            "password": "my_mapped_pw1"
        },
        {
            "user": "my_mapped_user2",
            "password": "A6D4C53619FFFF4DF252A0E595EDB0A12CA44E16AF154D0ED08F687E81604BFF42218B4EBA9F3EF8D907CF35E74ABDAA"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Anonymous user mapping

When backend authenticator mapping is not in use
(`authenticator_options=pam_backend_mapping=none`), the PAM authenticator
supports a limited version of
[user mapping](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/user-and-group-mapping-with-pam/).
It requires less configuration but is also less accurate than proper mapping.
Anonymous mapping is enabled in MaxScale if the following user exists:
- Empty username (e.g. `''@'%'` or `''@'myhost.com'`)
- `plugin = 'pam'`
- Proxy grant is on (The query `SHOW GRANTS FOR user@host;` returns at least one
row with `GRANT PROXY ON ...`)

When the authenticator detects such users, anonymous account mapping is enabled
for the hosts of the anonymous users. To verify this, enable the info log
(`log_info=1` in MaxScale config file). When a client is logging in using the
anonymous user account, MaxScale will log a message starting with "Found
matching anonymous user ...".

When mapping is on, the MaxScale PAM authenticator does not require client
accounts to exist in the `mysql.user`-table received from the backend. MaxScale
only requires that the hostname of the incoming client matches the host field of
one of the anonymous users (comparison performed using `LIKE`). If a match is
found, MaxScale attempts to authenticate the client to the local machine with
the username and password supplied. The PAM service used for authentication is
read from the `authentication_string`-field of the anonymous user. If
authentication was successful, MaxScale then uses the username and password to
log to the backends.

Anonymous mapping is only attempted if the client username is not found in the
`mysql.user`-table as explained in [Configuration](#configuration). This means,
that if a user is found and the authentication fails, anonymous authentication
is not attempted even when it could use a different PAM service with a different
outcome.

Setting up PAM group mapping for the MariaDB server is a more involved process
as the server requires details on which Unix user or group is mapped to which
MariaDB user. See
[this guide](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/configuring-pam-authentication-and-user-mapping-with-unix-authentication/)
for more details. Performing all the steps in the guide also on the MaxScale
machine is not required, as the MaxScale PAM plugin only checks that the client
host matches an anonymous user and that the client (with the username and
password it provided) can log into the local PAM configuration. If using normal
password authentication, simply generating the Unix user and password should be
enough.

## Implementation details and limitations

The general PAM authentication scheme is difficult for a proxy such as MaxScale.
An application using the PAM interface needs to define a *conversation function*
to allow the OS PAM modules to communicate with the client, possibly exchanging
multiple messages. This works when a client logs in to a normal server, but not
with MaxScale since it needs to autonomously log into multiple backends. For
MaxScale to successfully log into the servers, the messages and answers need to
be predefined. The passwords given to MaxScale need to work as is when MaxScale
logs into the backends. This requirement prevents the use of one-time passwords.

The MaxScale PAM authentication module supports two password modes. In normal
mode, client authentication begins with MaxScale sending an
AuthSwitchRequest packet. In addition to the command, the packet contains the
client plugin name ("dialog" or "mysql_clear_password"), a message type byte (4)
and the message "Password: ". In the next packet, the client should send the
password, which MaxScale will forward to the PAM api running on the local
machine. If the password is correct, an OK packet is sent to the client. If the
local PAM api asks for  additional credentials as is typical in two-factor
authentication schemes, authentication fails. Informational messages such as
password expiration notifications are allowed. These are simply printed to the
log.

On the backend side, MaxScale expects the servers to act as MaxScale did towards
the client. The servers should send an AuthSwitchRequest packet as defined
above, MaxScale responds with the password received by the client authenticator
and finally backend replies with OK. Informational messages from backends are
only printed to the info-log.

### Two-factor authentication support

MaxScale supports a limited form of two-factor authentication with the
`pam_mode=password_2FA`-option. Since MaxScale uses the 2FA-code given by the
client to log in to the local PAM api as well as all the backends, the code must
be reusable. This prevents the use of any kind of centrally checked one-use
codes. Time-based codes work, assuming the backends are checking the codes
independently of each other. Automatic reconnection features (e.g.
readwritesplit-router) will not work, as the code has likely changed since
original authentication.

Optionally, the PAM configuration on the backend servers can be weakened such
that the servers only asks for the normal password. This way, MaxScale will
check the 2FA-code of the incoming client, while MaxScale logs into the backends
using only the password.

Due to technical reasons, MaxScale does not forward the password prompts from
the PAM api to the client. MaxScale will always ask for "Password" and
"Verification code", even if the PAM api asks for other items. This prevents the
use of authentication schemes where a specific question must be answered (e.g.
"Input code Nr. 5"). This is not a significant limitation, as such schemes would
not work with backend servers anyway.

## Test tool

MaxScale binary directory contains the *test_pam_login*-executable. This simple
program asks for a username, password and PAM service and then uses the given
credentials to login to the given service. *test_pam_login* uses the same code
as MaxScale itself to communicate with the OS PAM interface and may be useful
for diagnosing PAM login issues.
