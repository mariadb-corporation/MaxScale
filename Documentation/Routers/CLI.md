# CLI

The command line interface as used by `maxadmin`. The _CLI_ router requires the use
of the `maxscaled` protocol.

## Configuration

Two components are required to run the command line interface for
_maxadmin_; a service and a listener. The listener may either use a Unix domain socket
or an internet socket.

The default entries required are shown below.

```
[CLI]
type=service
router=cli

# Unix Domain Socket
[CLI Unix Listener]
type=listener
service=CLI
protocol=maxscaled
socket=default

# Internet Socket
[CLI Inet Listener]
type=listener
service=CLI
protocol=maxscaled
address=localhost
port=6603
```

In the example above, two listeners have been specified; one that listens on the
default Unix domain socket and one that listens on the default port. In the latter
case, if the `address=` entry is removed, connections are allowed from any machine
on your network.

In the former case, if the value of `socket` is changed and in the latter case,
if the value of `port` is changed, _maxadmin_ must be invoked with the `-S` and
`-P` options, respectively.

If Unix domain sockets are used, the connection is secure, but _maxadmin_
can only be used on the same host where MariaDB MaxScale runs. If internet sockets
are used, the connection is _inherently insecure_ but _maxadmin_ can be used from
another host than the one where MariaDB MaxScale runs.

Note that the latter approach is **deprecated** and will be removed in a future
version of MariaDB MaxScale.
