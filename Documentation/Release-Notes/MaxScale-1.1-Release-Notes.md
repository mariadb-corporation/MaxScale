## Known Issues

There are a number bugs and known limitations within this version of MaxScale, the most serious of this are listed below.

* The Read/Write Splitter is a little too strict when it receives errors from slave servers during execution of session commands. This can result in sessions being terminated in situation in which MaxScale could recover without terminating the sessions.

* MaxScale can not manage authentication that uses wildcard matching in hostnames in the mysql.user table of the backend database. The only wildcards that can be used are in IP address entries.

* When users have different passwords based on the host from which they connect MaxScale is unable to determine which password it should use to connect to the backend database. This results in failed connections and unusable usernames in MaxScale.

* Service init script is missing after upgrade from 1.0 in RPM-based system. Can be fixed by reinstalling the package ('yum reinstall maxscale' or 'rpm -i --force /maxscale-1.1.rpm')

* Binlog Router Plugin is compatible with MySQL 5.6 and MariaDB 5.5  
  Binlog Router Plugin compatibility with MariaDB 10 is alpha

* LONGBLOG are currently not supported.

* Galera Cluster variables, such as @@wsrep_node_name, are not resolved by the embedded MariaDB parser.

* The Database Firewall filter does not support multi-statements. Using them will result in an error being sent to the client.
