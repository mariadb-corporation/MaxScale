# MaxScale Resource

The MaxScale resource represents a MaxScale instance and it is the core on top
of which the modules build upon.

[TOC]

## Resource Operations

## Get global information

```
GET /v1/maxscale
```

Retrieve global information about a MaxScale instance. This includes various
file locations, configuration options and version information.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale")}}
```

## Update MaxScale parameters

```
PATCH /v1/maxscale
```

Update MaxScale parameters. The request body must define updated values for the
`data.attributes.parameters` object. The parameters that can be modified are
listed in the `/v1/maxscale/modules/maxscale` endpoint and have the `modifiable`
value set to `true`.

#### Response

Parameters modified:

`Status: 204 No Content`

Invalid JSON body:

`Status: 400 Bad Request`

## Get thread information

```
GET /v1/maxscale/threads/:id
```

Get the information and statistics of a particular thread. The _:id_ in
the URI must map to a valid thread number between 0 and the configured
value of `threads`.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale/threads/0")}}
```

## Get information for all threads

```
GET /v1/maxscale/threads
```

Get the information for all threads. Returns a collection of threads resources.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale/threads")}}
```

## Get logging information

```
GET /v1/maxscale/logs
```

Get information about the current state of logging, enabled log files and the
location where the log files are stored.

**Note:** The parameters in this endpoint are a subset of the parameters in the
  `/v1/maxscale` endpoint. Because of this, the parameters in this endpoint are
  deprecated as of MaxScale 6.0.

**Note:** In MaxScale 2.5 the `log_throttling` and `ms_timestamp` parameters
  were incorrectly named as `throttling` and `highprecision`. In MaxScale 6,
  the parameter names are now correct which means the parameters declared here
  aren't fully backwards compatible.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale/logs")}}
```

## Get log data

```
GET /v1/maxscale/logs/data
```

Get the contents of the MaxScale logs. This endpoint was added in MaxScale 6.

To navigate the log, use the `prev` link to move backwards to older log
entries. The latest log entries can be read with the `last` link.

The entries are sorted in ascending order by the time they were logged. This
means that with the default parameters, the latest logged event is the last
element in the returned array.

#### Parameters

This endpoint supports the following parameters:

- `page[size]`

  - Set number of rows of data to read. By default, 50 rows of data are read
    from the log.

- `page[cursor]`

  - Set position from where the log data is retrieved. The default position to
    retrieve the log data is the end of the log.

    This value should not be modified by the user and the values returned in the
    `links` object should be used instead. This way the navigation will provide
    a consistent view of the log that does not overlap.

    Optionally, the `id` values in the returned data can be used as the values
    for this parameter to read data from a known point in the file.

- `priority`

  - Include messages only from these log levels. The default is to include all
    messages.

    The value given should be a comma-separated list of log priorities. The
    priorities are `alert`, `error`, `warning`, `notice`, `info` and
    `debug`. Note that the `debug` log level is only used in debug builds of
    MaxScale.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale/logs/data/?page[size]=3")}}
```

## Get log entries

```
GET /v1/maxscale/logs/entries
```

Get the contents of the MaxScale logs as separate entries. This endpoint was
added in MaxScale 24.02. This endpoint is nearly identical to the
`/v1/maxscale/logs/data` endpoint except that this is a resource collection
where each log line is a separate resource.

#### Parameters

This endpoint supports the same parameters as [/maxscale/logs/data](#get-log-data).

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale/logs/entries/?page[size]=3")}}
```

## Stream log data

```
GET /v1/maxscale/logs/stream
```

Stream the contents of the MaxScale logs. This endpoint was added in MaxScale 6.

This endpoint opens a [WebSocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)
connection and streams the contents of the log to it. Each WebSocket message
will contain the JSON representation of the log message. The JSON is formatted
in the same way as the values in the `log` array of the `/v1/maxscale/logs/data`
endpoint:

```javascript
{
    "id": "572",
    "message": "MaxScale started with 8 worker threads, each with a stack size of 8388608 bytes.",
    "priority": "notice",
    "timestamp": "2020-09-25 10:01:29"
}
```

### Limitations

* If the client writes any data to the open socket, it will be treated as
  an error and the stream is closed.

* The WebSocket ping and close commands are not yet supported and will be
  treated as errors.

* When `maxlog` is used as source of log data, any log messages logged after log
  rotation will not be sent if the file was moved or truncated. To fetch new
  events after log rotation, reopen the WebSocket connection.

#### Parameters

This endpoint supports the following parameters:

- `page[cursor]`

  - Set position from where the log data is retrieved. The default position to
    retrieve the log data is the end of the log.

    To stream data from a known point, first read the data via the
    `/v1/maxscale/logs/data` endpoint and then use the `id` value of the newest
    log message (i.e. the first value in the `log` array) to start the stream.

- `priority`

  - Include messages only from these log levels. The default is to include all
    messages.

    The value given should be a comma-separated list of log priorities. The
    priorities are `alert`, `error`, `warning`, `notice`, `info` and
    `debug`. Note that the `debug` log level is only used in debug builds of
    MaxScale.

#### Response

Upgrade started:

`Status: 101 Switching Protocols`

Client didn't request a WebSocket upgrade:

`Status: 426 Upgrade Required`

## Update logging parameters

**Note:** The modification of logging parameters via this endpoint has
  deprecated in MaxScale 6.0. The parameters should be modified with the
  `/v1/maxscale` endpoint instead.

  Any PATCH requests done to this endpoint will be redirected to the
  `/v1/maxscale` endpoint. Due to the misspelling of the `ms_timestamp` and
  `log_throttling` parameters, this is not fully backwards compatible.

```
PATCH /v1/maxscale/logs
```

Update logging parameters. The request body must define updated values for the
`data.attributes.parameters` object. All logging parameters can be altered at runtime.

#### Response

Parameters modified:

`Status: 204 No Content`

Invalid JSON body:

`Status: 400 Bad Request`

## Flush and rotate log files

```
POST /v1/maxscale/logs/flush
```

Flushes any pending messages to disk and reopens the log files. The body of the
message is ignored.

#### Response

`Status: 204 No Content`

## Reload TLS certificates

```
POST /v1/maxscale/tls/reload
```

Reloads all TLS certificates for listeners and servers as well as the REST API
itself. If the reloading fails, the old certificates will remain in use for the
objects that failed to reload. This also causes the JWT signature keys to be
reloaded if one of the asymmetric key algorithms is being used. If JWTs are
being signed with a random symmetric keys, a new random key is created.

The reloading is not transactional: if a single listener or server fails to
reload its certificates, the remaining ones are not reloaded. This means that a
failed reload can partially reload certificates. The REST API certificates are
only reloaded if all other certificate reloads were successful.

#### Response

`Status: 204 No Content`

## Get a loaded module

```
GET /v1/maxscale/modules/:name
```

Retrieve information about a loaded module. The _:name_ must be the name of a
valid loaded module or either `maxscale` or `servers`.

The `maxscale` module will display the global configuration options
(i.e. everything under the `[maxscale]` section) as a module.

The `servers` module displays the server object type and the configuration
parameters it accepts as a module.

Any parameter with the `modifiable` value set to `true` can be modified
at runtime using a PATCH command on the corresponding object endpoint.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale/modules/readwritesplit")}}
```

## Get all loaded modules

```
GET /v1/maxscale/modules
```

Retrieve information about all loaded modules.

This endpoint supports the `load=all` parameter. When defined, all modules
located in the MaxScale module directory (`libdir`) will be loaded. This allows
one to see the parameters of a module before the object is created.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale/modules")}}
```

## Call a module command

For read-only commands:

```
GET /v1/maxscale/modules/:module/:command
```

For commands that can modify data:

```
POST /v1/maxscale/modules/:module/:command
```

Modules can expose commands that can be called via the REST API. The module
resource lists all commands in the `data.attributes.commands` list. Each value
is a command sub-resource identified by its `id` field and the HTTP method the
command uses is defined by the `attributes.method` field.

The _:module_ in the URI must be a valid name of a loaded module and _:command_
must be a valid command identifier that is exposed by that module. All
parameters to the module commands are passed as HTTP request parameters.

Here is an example POST requests to the mariadbmon module command _reset-replication_ with
two parameters, the name of the monitor instance and the server name:

```
POST /v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/reset-replication?MariaDB-Monitor&server1
```

#### Response

Command with output:

`Status: 200 OK`

```javascript
{
    "links": {
        "self": "http://localhost:8989/v1/maxscale/modules/mariadbmon/reset-replication"
    },
    "meta": [ // Output of module command (module dependent)
        {
            "name": "value"
        }
    ]
}
```

The contents of the `meta` field will contain the output of the module
command. This output depends on the command that is being executed. It can
contain any valid JSON value.

Command with no output:

`Status: 204 No Content`

## Classify a statement

```
GET /v1/maxscale/query_classifier/classify?sql=<statement>
```

Classify provided statement and return the result.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`

```
GET /v1/maxscale/query_classifier/classify?sql=SELECT+1
```

```javascript
{{get("/v1/maxscale/query_classifier/classify?sql=SELECT+1")}}
```
