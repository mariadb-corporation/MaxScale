### Create a network user

```

  * The password for this user

* `data.attributes.account`
  * Set to `admin` for administrative users and `basic` to read-only users

Only admin accounts can perform POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH requests. If a basic
account performs one of the aforementioned request, the REST API will respond
with a `401 Unauthorized` error.

Here is an example request body defining the network user _my-user_ with the
password _my-password_ that is allowed to execute only read-only operations.

```javascript
{
    "data": {
        "id": "my-user", // The user to create
        "type": "inet", // The type of the user
        "attributes": {
            "password": "my-password", // The password to use for the user
            "account": "basic" // The type of the account
        }
    }
}
```
