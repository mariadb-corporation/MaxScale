# Limitations and Known Issues within MariaDB MaxScale

This document lists known issues and limitations in MariaDB MaxScale and its
plugins. Since limitations are related to specific plugins, this document is
divided into several sections.

[TOC]

## Configuration limitations

In versions 2.1.2 and earlier, the configuration files are limited to 1024
characters per line. This limitation was increased to 16384 characters in
MaxScale 2.1.3. MaxScale 2.3.0 increased this limit to 16777216 characters.

In versions 2.2.12 and earlier, the section names in the configuration files
were limited to 49 characters. This limitation was increased to 1023 characters
in MaxScale 2.2.13.

### Multiple MaxScales on same server

Starting with MaxScale 2.4.0, on systems with Linux kernels 3.9 or newer due to
the addition of SO_REUSEPORT support, it is possible for multiple MaxScale
instances to listen on the same network port if the directories used by both
instances are completely separate and there are no conflicts which can cause
unexpected splitting of connections. This will only happen if users explicitly
tell MaxScale to ignore the default directories and will not happen in normal
use.

## Security limitations

### MariaDB 10.2

The parser of MaxScale correctly parses `WITH` statements, but fails to
collect columns, functions and tables used in the `SELECT` defining the
`WITH` clause.

Consequently, the database firewall will **not** block `WITH` statements
where the `SELECT` of the `WITH` clause refers to forbidden columns.

## MariaDB Default Values

MaxScale assumes that certain configuration parameters in MariaDB are set to
their default values. These include but are not limited to:

* `autocommit`: Autocommit is enabled for all new connections.
* `tx_read_only`: Transactions use `READ WRITE` permissions by default.

## Query Classification

### Transaction Boundary Detection

If a module in MaxScale requires tracking of transaction boundaries but does not
require query classification, a custom parser is used to detect them. Currently
the only situation in which this parser is used is when a `readconnroute`
service uses the `cache` filter.

The custom parser detects a subset of the full SQL syntax used to start
transactions. This means that more complex statements will not be fully parsed
and will cause the transaction state to not match the real state on the
database. For example, `SET @my_var = (SELECT 1), autocommit = 0` is not parsed
by the custom parser and causes the autocommit modification to not be noticed.

### XA Transactions

MaxScale will treat statements executed after `XA START` and before `XA END` as
if they were executed in a normal read-write transaction started with `START
TRANSACTION`. This means that only XA transactions in the ACTIVE state will be
routed as transactions and all statements after `XA END` are routed normally.

XA transactions and normal transactions are mutually exclusive in MariaDB. This
means that a `START TRANSACTION` command will fail if the connection already has
an open XA transaction. MaxScale currently only inspects the SQL and deduces the
transaction state from that. If a transaction fails to start due to an open XA
transaction, the state in MaxScale and in MariaDB can be different and MaxScale
will keep routing statements as if they were inside of a transaction. However,
as this is an unlikely scenario, usually no action needs to be taken.

## Prepared Statements

For its proper functioning, MaxScale needs in general to be aware of the
transaction state and _autocommit_ mode. In order to be that, MaxScale
parses statements going through it.

However, if a transaction is committed or rolled back, or the autocommit
mode is changed using a prepared statement, MaxScale will miss that and its
internal state will be incorrect, until the transaction state or autocommit
mode is changed using an explicit statement.

For instance, after the following sequence of commands, MaxScale will still
think _autocommit_ is on:
```
set autocommit=1
PREPARE hide_autocommit FROM "set autocommit=0"
EXECUTE hide_autocommit
```

To ensure that MaxScale functions properly, do not commit or rollback a
transaction or change the autocommit mode using a prepared statement.

## Protocol limitations

### Limitations with MySQL/MariaDB Protocol support (MariaDBClient)

* Compression is not included in the server handshake.

* If a `KILL [CONNECTION] <ID>` statement is executed, MaxScale will intercept
  it. If the ID matches a MaxScale session ID, it will be closed, similarly to
  how MariaDB does it. If the `KILL CONNECTION USER <user>` form is given, all
  connections with a matching username will be closed.

* MariaDB MaxScale does not support `KILL QUERY ID <query_id>` type
  statements. If a query by a query ID is to be killed, it needs to be done
  directly on the backend databases.

* Any `KILL` commands executed using a prepared statement are ignored by
  MaxScale. If any are executed, it is highly likely that the wrong connection
  ends up being killed.

* The change user command (COM_CHANGE_USER) only works with standard
  authentication.

* If a COM_CHANGE_USER succeeds on MaxScale yet fails on the server the session
  ends up in an inconsistent state. This can happen if the password of the
  target user is changed and MaxScale uses old user account data when processing
  the change user. In such a situation, MaxScale and server will disagree on the
  current user. This can affect e.g. reconnections.

## Authenticator limitations

### Limitations in the MySQL authenticator (MariaDBAuth)

* MySQL old style passwords are not supported. MySQL versions 4.1 and newer use
a new authentication protocol which does not support pre-4.1 style passwords.

* When users have different passwords based on the host from which they connect
MariaDB MaxScale is unable to determine which password it should use to connect
to the backend database. This results in failed connections and unusable
usernames in MariaDB MaxScale.

## Filter limitations

### Tee filter limitations (tee)

The Tee filter does not support binary protocol prepared statements. The
execution of a prepared statements through a service that uses the tee filter is
not guaranteed to succeed on the service where the filter branches to as it does
on the original service.

This possibility exists due to the fact that the binary protocol prepared
statements are identified by a server-generated ID. The ID sent to the client
from the main service is not guaranteed to be the same that is sent by the
branch service.

## Monitor limitations

A server can only be monitored by one monitor. Two or more monitors monitoring
the same server is considered an error.

### Limitations with Galera Cluster Monitoring (galeramon)

The default master selection is based only on MIN(wsrep_local_index). This
can be influenced with the server priority mechanic described in the
[Galera Monitor](../Monitors/Galera-Monitor.md) manual.

## Router limitations

Refer to individual router documentation for a list of their limitations.

# ETL Limitations

The ETL feature in MaxScale always uses the MariaDB Connector/ODBC driver to
perform the data loading into MariaDB. The recommended minimum version of the
connector is 3.1.18. Older versions of the driver suffer from problems that may
manifest as crashes or memory leaks. The driver must be installed on the system
in order for the ETL feature to work.

The data loading into MariaDB is done with `autocommit`, `unique_checks` and
`foreign_key_checks` disabled inside of a single transaction. This is done to
leverage the optimizations done for InnoDB that allows faster insertions into
empty tables. When loading data into MariaDB versions 10.5 or older, this can
translate into long rollback times in case the ETL operation fails.

## ETL Limitations with PostgreSQL as the Source

For ETL operations that migrate data from PostgreSQL, we recommend using the
official PostgreSQL ODBC driver. Use of other PostgreSQL ODBC drivers is
possible but not recommended: correct configuration of the driver is necessary
to prevent the driver from consuming too much memory.

### Limitations in Automatic SQL Generation

* Triggers on tables are not migrated automatically.

* Check constraints are defined using the native PostgreSQL
  syntax. Incompatibilities must be manually fixed.

* All indexes specific to PostgreSQL will be converted into normal indexes in
  MariaDB.

* The `GEOMETRY` type is assumed to be the type provided by PostGIS. It is
  converted into a MariaDB `GEOMETRY` type and is extracted using `ST_AsText`.

## ETL Limitations with Generic ODBC Targets

It is the responsibility of the end-user to correctly configure the ODBC
driver. Some drivers read the whole resultset into memory by default which will
result in MaxScale running out of memory

* ETL operations that operate on more than one catalog are not supported.
