# Introduction

MariaDB MaxScale is a complex application and as such is bound to have bugs and support issues that occur from time to time. There are a number of things we need to consider for the development stages and long term supportability of MariaDB MaxScale

* Flexible logging of MariaDB MaxScale activity

* Support for connecting a debugger to MariaDB MaxScale

* A diagnostic interface to MariaDB MaxScale

The topic of logging has already been discussed in another document in this series of documents about MariaDB MaxScale and will not be covered further here.

# Debugger Support

Beyond the language support for debugging using tools such as gdb, MariaDB MaxScale will also offer convenience functions for the debugger to call and a command line argument that is useful to run MariaDB MaxScale under the debugger.

## Command Line Option

Normally when MariaDB MaxScale starts it will place itself in the background and setup the signal masks so that it is immune to the normal set of signals that will cause the process to exit, SIGINT and SIGQUIT. This behavior is normally what is required, however if you wish to run MariaDB MaxScale under the control of a debugger it is useful to suppress this behavior.  A command line option, -d is provided to turn off this behavior.

% gdb maxscale

(gdb) run -d

## Convenience Functions

A set of convenience functions is provided that may be used within the debugger session to extract information from MariaDB MaxScale.

### Printing Services

A service within MariaDB MaxScale provides the encapsulation of the port MariaDB MaxScale listen on, the protocol it uses, the set of servers it may route to and the routing method to use. Two functions exists that allow you to display the details of the services and may be executed from within a debugger session.

The printAllServices() function will print all the defined services within MariaDB MaxScale and is invoked using the call syntax of the debugger.

(gdb) call printAllServices()

Service 0x60da20

	Service:		Debug Service

	Router:			debugcli (0x7ffff5a7c2a0)

	Started:		Thu Jun 20 15:13:32 2013

	Backend databases

	Total connections:	1

	Currently connected:	1

Service 0x60d010

	Service:		Test Service

	Router:			readconnroute (0x7ffff5c7e260)

	Started:		Thu Jun 20 15:13:32 2013

	Backend databases

		127.0.0.1:3308  Protocol: MySQLBackend

		127.0.0.1:3307  Protocol: MySQLBackend

		127.0.0.1:3306  Protocol: MySQLBackend

	Total connections:	1

	Currently connected:	1

(gdb) 

It is possible to print an individual service if you know the memory address of the service.

(gdb) call printService(0x60da20)

Service 0x60da20

	Service:		Debug Service

	Router:			debugcli (0x7ffff5a7c2a0)

	Started:		Thu Jun 20 15:13:32 2013

	Backend databases

	Total connections:	1

	Currently connected:	1

(gdb) 

### Printing Sessions

Sessions represent the data for a client that is connecting through MariaDB MaxScale, there will be a session for each client and one for each listener for a specific port/protocol combination. Similarly there are two calls to print all or a particular session.

(gdb) call printAllSessions()

Session 0x60fdf0

	Service:	Debug Service (0x60da20)

	Client DCB:	0x60f6c0

	Connected:	Thu Jun 20 15:13:32 2013

Session 0x60f620

	Service:	Test Service (0x60d010)

	Client DCB:	0x60ead0

	Connected:	Thu Jun 20 15:13:32 2013

(gdb) call printSession(0x60fdf0)

Session 0x60fdf0

	Service:	Debug Service (0x60da20)

	Client DCB:	0x60f6c0

	Connected:	Thu Jun 20 15:13:32 2013

(gdb) 

### Printing Servers

Servers are a representation of the backend database to which MariaDB MaxScale may route SQL statements. Similarly two calls exist to print server details.

(gdb) call printAllServers()

Server 0x60d9a0

	Server:			127.0.0.1

	Protocol:		MySQLBackend

	Port:			3308

Server 0x60d920

	Server:			127.0.0.1

	Protocol:		MySQLBackend

	Port:			3307

Server 0x60d8a0

	Server:			127.0.0.1

	Protocol:		MySQLBackend

	Port:			3306

(gdb) call printServer(0x60d920)

Server 0x60d920

	Server:			127.0.0.1

	Protocol:		MySQLBackend

	Port:			3307

(gdb) 

### Modules

MariaDB MaxScale makes significant use of modules, shared objects, that are loaded on demand based on the configuration. A routine exists that will print the currently loaded modules.

(gdb) call printModules()

Module Name     | Module Type | Version

-----------------------------------------------------

telnetd         | Protocol    | V1.0.0

MySQLClient     | Protocol    | V1.0.0

testroute       | Router      | V1.0.0

debugcli        | Router      | V1.0.0

readconnroute   | Router      | V1.0.0

(gdb) 

### Descriptor Control Blocks

The Descriptor Control Block (DCB) is an important concept within MariaDB MaxScale since it is this block that is passed to the polling system, when an event occurs it is that structure that is available and from this structure it must be possible to navigate to all other structures that contain state regarding the session and protocol in use.

![image alt text](images/image_0.png)

Similar print routines exist for the DCB

(gdb) call printAllDCBs()

DCB: 0x60ead0

	DCB state: 		DCB for listening socket

	Queued write data:	0

	Statistics:

		No. of Reads: 	0

		No. of Writes:	0

		No. of Buffered Writes:	0

		No. of Accepts: 0

DCB: 0x60f6c0

	DCB state: 		DCB for listening socket

	Queued write data:	0

	Statistics:

		No. of Reads: 	0

		No. of Writes:	0

		No. of Buffered Writes:	0

		No. of Accepts: 0

(gdb) call printDCB(0x60ead0)

DCB: 0x60ead0

	DCB state: 		DCB for listening socket

	Queued write data:	0

	Statistics:

		No. of Reads: 	0

		No. of Writes:	0

		No. of Buffered Writes:	0

		No. of Accepts: 0

(gdb) 

# Diagnostic Interface

It is possible to configure a service to run within MariaDB MaxScale that will allow a user to telnet to a port on the machine and be connected to MariaDB MaxScale. This is configured by creating a service that uses the debugcli routing module and the telnetd protocol with an associated listener.  The service does not require any backend databases to be configured since the router never forwards any data, it merely accepts commands and executes them, returning data to the user.

The example below shows the configuration that is required to set-up a debug interface that listens for incoming telnet connections on port 4442.

[Debug Service]

type=service

router=debugcli

[Debug Listener]

type=listener

service=Debug Service

protocol=telnetd

port=4442

The Debug Service section sets up a service with no backend database servers, but with a debugcli module as the router. This module will implement the commands and send the data back to the client.

The debugcli accepts router options of either developer or user, these are used to control the mode of the user interface. If no router options are given then the CLI is in user mode by default.

The Debug Listener section setups the protocol and port combination and links that to the service.

Assuming a configuration that includes the debug service, with the listening port set to 4442, to connect from the machine that runs MariaDB MaxScale you must first install telnet and then simply call telnet to connect.

-bash-4.1$ telnet localhost 4442

Trying 127.0.0.1...

Connected to localhost.

Escape character is '^]'.

Welcome the MariaDB MaxScale Debug Interface (V1.1.0).

Type help for a list of available commands.

MaxScale login: admin

Password: 

MaxScale> 

As delivered MariaDB MaxScale uses a default login name of admin with the password of mariadb for connections to the debug interface. Users may be added to the CLI by use of the add user command.

This places you in the debug command line interface of MariaDB MaxScale, there is a help system that will display the commands available to you

**MaxScale> **help

Available commands:

    add user

    clear server

    disable log

    enable log

    list [listeners|modules|services|servers|sessions]

    reload [config|dbusers]

    remove user

    restart [monitor|service]

    set server

    show [dcbs|dcb|dbusers|epoll|modules|monitors|server|servers|services|service|session|sessions|users]

    shutdown [maxscale|monitor|service]

Type help command to see details of each command.

Where commands require names as arguments and these names contain

whitespace either the \ character may be used to escape the whitespace

or the name may be enclosed in double quotes ".

**MaxScale> **

Different command help is shown in user mode and developer mode, in user mode the help for the show command is;

**MaxScale>** help show

Available options to the show command:

    dcbs       Show all descriptor control blocks (network connections)

    dcb        Show a single descriptor control block e.g. show dcb 0x493340

    dbusers    Show statistics and user names for a service's user table.

		Example : show dbusers <service name>

    epoll      Show the poll statistics

    modules    Show all currently loaded modules

    monitors   Show the monitors that are configured

    server     Show details for a named server, e.g. show server dbnode1

    servers    Show all configured servers

    services   Show all configured services in MaxScale

    service    Show a single service in MaxScale, may be passed a service name

    session    Show a single session in MaxScale, e.g. show session 0x284830

    sessions   Show all active sessions in MaxScale

    users      Show statistics and user names for the debug interface

**MaxScale>** 

However in developer mode the help is;

**MaxScale>** help show

Available options to the show command:

    dcbs       Show all descriptor control blocks (network connections)

    dcb        Show a single descriptor control block e.g. show dcb 0x493340

    dbusers    Show statistics and user names for a service's user table

    epoll      Show the poll statistics

    modules    Show all currently loaded modules

    monitors   Show the monitors that are configured

    server     Show details for a server, e.g. show server 0x485390

    servers    Show all configured servers

    services   Show all configured services in MaxScale

    session    Show a single session in MaxScale, e.g. show session 0x284830

    sessions   Show all active sessions in MaxScale

    users      Show statistics and user names for the debug interface

**MaxScale>** 

The commands available are very similar to those described above to print things from the debugger, the advantage being that you do not need a debug version or a debugger to use them.

## Listing Services

The list services command is designed to give a concise tabular view of the currently configured services within MaxScale along with key data that summarizes the use being made of the service.

**MaxScale>** list services

Service Name              | Router Module        | #Users | Total Sessions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test Service              | readconnroute        |      1 |     1

Split Service             | readwritesplit       |      1 |     1

Debug Service             | debugcli             |      2 |     2

**MaxScale>**

This provides a useful mechanism to see what is configured and provide the service names that can be passed to a show service command.

## Listing Listeners

The list listeners command outputs a table that provides the current set of listeners within the MariaDB MaxScale instance and shows the status of each listener.

**MaxScale>** list listeners

Service Name         | Protocol Module    | Address         | Port  | State

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test Service         | MySQLClient        | (null)          |  4006 | Running

Split Service        | MySQLClient        | (null)          |  4007 | Running

Debug Service        | telnetd            | localhost       |  4242 | Running

**MaxScale>**

## Listing Servers

The list servers command will display a table that contains a row for every server defined in the configuration file. The row contains the server name that can be passed to the show server command, the address and port of the server, its current status and the number of connections to that server from MariaDB MaxScale.

**MaxScale>** list servers

Server             | Address         | Port  | Status             | Connections

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

server1            | 127.0.0.1       |  3306 | Running            |    0

server2            | 127.0.0.1       |  3307 | Slave, Running     |    0

server3            | 127.0.0.1       |  3308 | Master, Running    |    0

server4            | 127.0.0.1       |  3309 | Slave, Running     |    0

**MaxScale>**

## Listing Modules

The list modules command displays a table of all the modules loaded within MariaDB MaxScale.

**MaxScale> **list modules

Module Name     | Module Type | Version

-----------------------------------------------------

telnetd         | Protocol    | V1.0.1

	Number of connections:	0

	Current no. of connections:0

**MaxScale>**  

* Version string is available in the output only if the node is running.

* Node Id possible values:

* the value of server-id from MySQL or MariaDB servers in Master/Slave replication  setup.

* the value of ‘wsrep_local_index’ for Galera cluster nodes

* the value of ‘Ndb_cluster_node_id’ for SQL nodes in MySQL Cluster

* the -1 value for a failure getting one of these information

* Repl Depth is the replication depth level found by MaxScale MySQL Monitor

* Master Id is the master node, if available, for current server

* Slave Ids is the slave list for the current node, if available

Note, the Master Root Server used for routing decision is the server with master role and with lowest replication depth level. All slaves servers even if they are intermediate master are suitable for read statement routing decisions.

* Slave Delay is the found time difference used for Replication Lag support in routing decision, between the value read by the Slave (it was inserted into the master) and maxscale current time

	Value of 0 or less than monitor interval means there is no replication delay.

* Last Repl Heartbeat is the MaxScale timestamp read or inserted (if current server is master)

The Replication Heartbeat table is updated by MySQL replication, starting MariaDB MaxScale when there is a significant slave delay may result that Slave Delay and  Last Repl Heartbeat are not available for some time in the slave server details

## There may be other status description such us:

	Slave of External Server: the node is slave of a server not configured

  in MaxScale (by MySQL monitor)

	Master Stickiness:		 the Master node is kept (by Galera monitor)

	Stale Status:		 the master node is kept even if the replication

  is not working (by MySQL monitor)

	Auth Error:			 Monitor was not able to login into backend

A few examples:

Server 0x1a5aae0 (server3)

	Server:			127.0.0.1

	Status:               	Master, Slave of External Server, Running

## Show Server

Details of an individual server can be displayed by using the show server command. In user mode the show server command is passed the name of the server to display, these names are the section names used in the configuration file.

**MaxScale>** show server server4

Server 0x6ec5d0 (server4)

	Server:			127.0.0.1

	Status:               	Down

	Protocol:			MySQLBackend

	Port:				3309

## Show Dbusers

The show dbuser command allows data regarding the table that holds the database users for a service to be displayed. It does not give the actual user data, but rather details of the hashtable distribution.

The show dbuser command takes different arguments in the two modes of MariaDB MaxScale, in user mode it may be passed the name of a service rather than an address, whilst in developer mode it needs the address of a user structure that has been extracted from a service.

In developer mode the show users commands must be passed the address of the user table, this can be extracted from the output of a show services command.

**MaxScale>** show services

## Show Monitors

The show monitors show the status of the database monitors. The address of the monitor can be used for the shutdown monitor and restart monitor commands.

**MaxScale>** show monitors

Monitor: 0x80a510

	Name:					MySQL Monitor
	Monitor running
	Sampling interval:		10000 milliseconds
	Replication lag:		enabled
	Detect Stale Master:	disabled
	Connect Timeout:		3 seconds
	Read Timeout:			1 seconds
	Write Timeout:			2 seconds
	Monitored servers:		127.0.0.1:3306, 127.0.0.1:3307, 127.0.0.1:3308, 127.0.0.1:3309

Monitor: 0x73d3d0

	Name:					Galera Monitor
	Monitor running
	Sampling interval:		7000 milliseconds
	Master Failback:		off
	Connect Timeout:		3 seconds
	Read Timeout:			1 seconds
	Write Timeout:			2 seconds
	Monitored servers:		127.0.0.1:3310, 127.0.0.1:3311, 127.0.0.1:3312

Monitor: 0x387b880

	Name:					NDB Cluster Monitor
	Monitor running
	Sampling interval:		8000 milliseconds
	Connect Timeout:		3 seconds
	Read Timeout:			1 seconds
	Write Timeout:			2 seconds
	Monitored servers:		127.0.0.1:3301, 162.243.90.81:3302

**MaxScale>**

Monitor timeouts used in monitors follow the rules of mysql_real_connect C API:

* Connect Timeout is the connect timeout in seconds.

* Read Timeout is the timeout in seconds for each attempt to read from the server. There are retries if necessary, so the total effective timeout value is three times the option value.

* Write Timeout is the timeout in seconds for each attempt to write to the server. There is a retry if necessary, so the total effective timeout value is two times the option value.

## Shutdown MariaDB MaxScale

The CLI can be used to shutdown the MariaDB MaxScale server by use of the shutdown command, it may be called with the argument either maxscale or gateway.

**MaxScale>** shutdown maxscale

## Shutdown monitor

The shutdown monitor command stops the thread that is used to run the monitor and will stop any update of the server status flags. This is useful prior to manual setting of the states of the server using the set server and clear server commands.

**MaxScale>** show monitors

Monitor: 0x80a510

	Name:			MySQL Monitor

	Monitor running

Sampling interval:	10000 milliseconds

	Monitored servers:	127.0.0.1:3306, 127.0.0.1:3307, 127.0.0.1:3308, 127.0.0.1:3309

**MaxScale>** shutdown monitor 0x80a510

**MaxScale>** show monitors

Monitor: 0x80a510

	Name:			MySQL Monitor

	Monitor stopped

	Sampling interval:	10000 milliseconds

	Monitored servers:	127.0.0.1:3306, 127.0.0.1:3307, 127.0.0.1:3308, 127.0.0.1:3309

**MaxScale>** 

It may take some time before a monitor actually stops following the issuing of a shutdown monitor command. Stopped monitors can be restarted by issuing a restart monitor command.

## Shutdown service

The shutdown service command can be used to stop the listener for a particular service. This will prevent any new clients from using the service but will not terminate any clients already connected to the service.

The shutdown service command needs the address of a service to be passed as an argument, this can be obtained by running show services.

**MaxScale>** set server 0x6ec840 slave

Valid options that are recognized by the set server command are running, master and slave. Please note that if the monitor is running it will reset the flags to match reality, this interface is really for use when the monitor is disabled.

In user mode there is no need to find the address of the server structure, the name of the server from the section header in the configuration file make be given. 

**MaxScale>** set server server1 slave

 

## Clear server

The clear server command is the complement to the set server command, it allows status bits related to a server to be cleared.

**MaxScale>** clear server 0x6ec840 slave

Likewise in user mode the server name may be given.

**MaxScale>** clear server server1 slave

## Reload users

The reload users command is used to force a service to go back and reload the table of database users from the backend database. This is the data used in the transparent authentication mechanism in the MySQL protocol. The command should be passed the address of the service as shown in the output of the show services command.

## Reload config

The reload config command can be used to force MariaDB MaxScale to re-read the maxscale.cnf and update itself to the latest configuration defined in that configuration file. It is also possible to force the reading of the configuration file by sending a HangUp signal (SIGHUP) to the maxscale process.

**MaxScale>** reload config

Reloading configuration from file.

**MaxScale>** 

Note, not all configuration elements can be changed dynamically currently. This mechanism can be used to add new services, servers to services, listeners to services and to update passwords. It can not be used to remove services, servers or listeners currently.

## Add user

The add user command is used to add new users to the debug CLI of MariaDB MaxScale. The default behavior of the CLI for MariaDB MaxScale is to have a login name of admin and a fixed password of mariadb. Adding new users will disable this default behavior and limit the login access to the users that are added.

**MaxScale>** add user admin july2013

User admin has been successfully added.

**MaxScale>** add user mark hambleden

User mark has been successfully added.

**MaxScale>** 

User names must be unique within the debug CLI, this excludes the admin default user, which may be redefined.

**MaxScale>** add user mark 22july 

User admin already exists.

**MaxScale>**** **

If you should forget or lose the the account details you may simply remove the passwd file in /var/cache/maxscale and the system will revert to the default behavior with admin/mariadb as the account.

## Enable/disable log

The enable/disable log command is used to enable/disable the log facility of MariaDB MaxScale. The default behavior for MariaDB MaxScale is to have all logs enabled in DEBUG version, and only error log in production release.

Examples:

**MaxScale>** help enable log

Available options to the enable command:

    log        Enable Log options for MaxScale, options trace | error | message E.g. enable log message.

**MaxScale>** help disable log

Available options to the disable command:

    log        Disable Log for MaxScale, Options: debug | trace | error | message E.g. disable log debug

**MaxScale>** disable log trace

**MaxScale>**

No output for these commands in the debug interface, but in the affected logs there is a message:

2013 11/14 16:08:33   ---	Logging is disabled	--

# Logging facility

MariaDB MaxScale generates output of its behavior to four distinct logs, error, messages, trace and debug log. Error and message logs are enabled by default but all logs can be dynamically enabled and disabled by using maxadmin utility, debug client interface (telnet) or optionally by using your own application through the client API.

## Log contents

By default all log files are located in : /var/log/maxscale and named as : 

skygw_errW.log, skygw_msgX.log, skygw_traceY.log and skygw_debugZ.log

where W, X, Y, and Z are sequence numbers for files within the same directory,

### Error log

Error log includes errors and warnings; things that occur during runtime and of which the user should at least be aware of. An entry in error log doesn’t necessarily mean a problem - it may be a notification of failed backend server, for example. 

Example:

MariaDB Corporation MaxScale	/home/jdoe/bin/develop/log/skygw_err1.log Mon Dec  8 13:28:15 2014

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

--- 	Logging is enabled.

2014-12-08 13:28:15   Error : Unable to find filter 'testfi' for service 'RW Split Router'

2014-12-08 13:28:26   MaxScale received signal SIGINT. Shutting down.

2014-12-08 13:28:27   MaxScale is shut down.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Message log

The content of message log consists of information about loaded modules, opened listen ports and other information about file locations etc. The amount of data written in message log is typically very small. 

Example:

MariaDB Corporation MaxScale	/home/jdoe/bin/develop/log/skygw_msg1.log Tue Dec  9 14:47:05 2014

### Trace log

Trace log includes information about available servers and their states, client sessions, queries being executed, routing decisions and other routing related data. Trace log can be found from the same directory with other logs but it is physically stored elsewhere, to OS's shared memory to reduce the latency caused by logging. The location of physical file is : /dev/shm/<pid>/skygw_traceX.log where ‘X’ is the same sequence number as in the file name in the /var/log/maxscale directory.

Individual trace log entry looks similar to those in other logs but there is some difference too. Some log entries include a number within square brackets to specify which client session they belong to. For example:

2014-12-09 14:52:36   [6]  Session write, routing to all servers.

Writing trace log for each client may produce so much data that it seriously affects on the performance of MariaDB MaxScale. It may also be difficult to follow a specific session if the log is flooded with data from other sessions. While it is possible to dynamically enable and disable trace log as a whole, one can also choose to explicitly enable trace logging for a specific session by first enabling trace log, finding out the session id of the interesting session, disabling trace log and finally enabling trace log only for a given session:

1. enable log trace (and examine the session id)

2. disable log trace

3. enable sessionlog trace <session id>

Example of trace log:

2014-12-09 14:52:59   Started RW Split Router client session [7] for 'maxuser' from 127.0.0.1

In the log, session’s life cycle is covered by annotating its beginning and the end. During the session, each statement is surrounded with ‘>’ and ‘<’ characters. Entries without ‘[<id>]’ belong to other than client sessions, monitor, for example.

## Managing logs

The log files are located in 

/var/log/maxscale

by default. If, however, trace and debug logs are enabled, only a soft link is created there. MariaDB MaxScale process creates a directory under 

/dev/shm/maxscale.<pid> 

where it stores the physical trace and debug log files. Link and physical files share the same name. These logs consume the main memory of the host they run on so it is important to archive or remove them periodically to avoid unnecessary main-memory consumption.

## Rotating logs

Log files may grow very large over time and that is why users may want to split log files into several smaller ones. That is called log rotation. User can rotate all logs by executing 

flush logs

Specific log file can be rotated by executing

flush log [error|message|trace|debug]

The commands above can be executed either by using maxadmin utility or via debug client API with telnet. The sequence number included in the log filename is used to separate files from each other. The logic behind sequence numbering is such that if the log directory is empty when MariaDB MaxScale is started, new log files will be created with sequence number 1 in their names, skygw_err1.log, for example. If files of the same type already exist, the new MariaDB MaxScale process opens the file with largest sequence number and applies into it. If existing log file isn’t writable for the user that MariaDB MaxScale runs on, new log file will be created with bigger sequence number.

More information about log files and administering them can be found from **MaxScale Administration Tutorial**.
