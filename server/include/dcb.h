/**
 * The data structure that is embedded witin a DCB and manages the complex memory
 * management issues of a DCB.
 *
 * The DCB structures are used as the user data within the polling loop. This means that
 * polling threads may aschronously wake up and access these structures. It is not possible
 * to simple remove the DCB from the epoll system and then free the data, as every thread
 * that is currently running an epoll call must wake up and re-issue the epoll_wait system
 * call, the is the only way we can be sure that no polling thread is pending a wakeup or
 * processing an event that will access the DCB.
 *
 * We solve this issue by making the dcb_free routine merely mark a DCB as a zombie and
 * place it on a special zombie list. Before placing the DCB on the zombie list we create
 * a bitmask with a bit set in it for each active polling thread. Each thread will call
 * a routine to process the zombie list at the end of the polling loop. This routine
 * will clear the bit value that corresponds to the calling thread. Once the bitmask
 * is completely cleared the DCB can finally be freed and removed from the zombie list.
