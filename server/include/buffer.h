/**
 * @file buffer.h  Definitions relating the gateway buffer manipulation facilities.
 *
 * These are used to store all data coming in form or going out to the client and the
 * backend structures.
 *
 * The buffers are designed to be used in linked lists and such that they may be passed
 * from one side of the gateway to another without the need to copy data. It may be the case
 * that not all of the data in the buffer is valid, to this end a start and end pointer are
 * included that point to the first valid byte in the buffer and the first byte after the
 * last valid byte. This allows data to be consumed from either end of the buffer whilst
 * still allowing for the copy free semantics of the buffering system.
 *
