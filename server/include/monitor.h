/**
 * The "Module Object" for a monitor module.
 *
 * The monitor modules are designed to monitor the backend databases that the gateway 
 * connects to and provide information regarding the status of the databases that
 * is used in the routing decisions.
 *
 * startMonitor is called to start the monitoring process, it is called on the main
 * thread of the gateway and is responsible for creating a thread for the monitor
 * itself to run on. This should use the entry points defined in the thread.h 
 * header file rather than make direct calls to the operating system thrading libraries.
 * The return from startMonitor is a void * handle that will be passed to all other monitor
 * API calls.
 *
 * stopMonitor is responsible for shuting down and destroying a monitor, it is called 
 * with the void * handle that was returned by startMonitor.
 *
 * registerServer is called to register a server that must be monitored with a running
 * monitor. this will be called with the handle returned from the startMonitor call and
 * the SERVER structure that the monitor must update and monitor. The SERVER structure
 * contains the information required to connect to the monitored server.
 *
 * unregisterServer is called to remove a server from the set of servers that need to be
 * monitored.
