/**
 * @file gwbitmask.c  Implementation of bitmask operations for the gateway
 *
 * We provide basic bitmask manipulation routines, the size of
 * the bitmask will grow dynamically based on the highest bit
 * number that is set or cleared within the bitmask.
 *
 * Bitmask growth happens in increments rather than via a single bit as
 * a time.
 * 
 * Please note limitations to these mechanisms:
 * 
 * 1. The initial size and increment size MUST be exact multiples of 8
 * 2. Only suitable for a compact set of bit numbers i.e. the numbering
 * needs to start near to 0 and grow without sizeable gaps
 * 3. It is assumed that a bit number bigger than the current size can
 * be accommodated by adding a single extra block of bits
 * 4. During copy, if memory cannot be allocated, a zero length bitmap is
 * created as the destination. This will test true for all bits clear, which
 * may be a serious error. However, the memory requirement is very small and
 * is only likely to fail in circumstances where a lot else is going wrong.
