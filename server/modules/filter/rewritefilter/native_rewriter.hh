/**
 * @brief NativeRewriter takes a "match template" where there are placeholders
 * for text that should be replaced in the corresponding "replace template".
 *
 * example:
 * match_template:   "select count(distinct @{1}) from @{2}"
 * replace_template: "select count(*) from (select distinct @{1} from @{2}) as t"
 *
 * TODO: There are very few examples of rewrites, but it is relatively certain that
 *       the distinction between an identifier and a number will be needed:
 *       @{1:s} and @{1:d}. Or 'i' and 'n' if that is clearer to users.
