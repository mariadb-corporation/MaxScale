/**
 * @brief RegexRewriter uses the match_template for a std::regex
 *        and replaces matches with the replace_template.
 *
 *        C++ regular expressions do not support extended replacement syntax
 *        (essentially placeholders) like pcre2 and boost. Instead, the
 *        matched parts are replaced with a literal replacement.
 *
 *        TODO: Add a class Pcre2Rewriter, if needed. The Native rewriter
 *              can probably handle everything, so this can wait for a
 *              feature request if a problem really cannot be solved
 *              with the NativeRewriter.
 *
 *        TODO: add an option to only replace the first occurrence.
