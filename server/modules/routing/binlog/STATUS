The binlog router contained here is a prototype implementation and
should not be consider as production ready.

The router has been written and tested with MySQL 5.6 as a reference
for the replication behaviour, more investigation and implementation
is likely to be needed in order to use other versions of MySQL,
MariaDB or Percona Server.

To Do List:

1. The router does not implement the replication heartbeat mechanism.

2. Performance measurements have yet to be made.
