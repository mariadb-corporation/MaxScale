The MySQL Replicant Library is a C++ library for reading MySQL
replication events, either by connecting to a server or by reading
from a file. To handle reading from a server, it includes a very
simple client.


Dependencies
------------

You need to have CMake version 2.8 or later and Boost version 1.35.0
or later since Asio is required.

To be able to run the unit tests, you have to have Google Test
installed. Google Test will be automatically installed if cmake is
called as:

   cmake . -DENABLE_DOWNLOADS=1

Building
--------

To build the entire package, it is first necessary to run CMake to build all the makefiles.

        cmake .
        make -j4

Some of the examples are using third-party software, which can require
extra parameters to be given to CMake.

If you want to perform an out-of-source build, you can just create a
build directory and execute CMake there.

      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake <source directory>
      make -j4


Building the mysql2lucene Example
---------------------------------

To build the mysql2lucene example, it is necessary to ensure that the
'FindCLucene.cmake' is in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, which on my machine
require me to write:

    cmake . -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH:String=/usr/share/kde4/apps/cmake/modules

In addition, there is a bug in the packaging of CLucene on Ubuntu in
that the 'clucene-config.h' file is placed in '/usr/lib/CLucene' but
not in '/usr/include/CLucene', causing compiler failure when
attempting to use CLucene. The 'CMakeLists.txt' file hacks around this
by adding the libraries explicitly, but it seems unnecessary.
