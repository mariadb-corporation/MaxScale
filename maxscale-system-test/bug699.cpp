I opened bug #509 some time ago, but that bug was handled specifically for the case of last_insert_id(). The crux of that bug still exists in 1.0.4 GA:

[root@max1 ~]# mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4006 -u maxuser -pmaxpwd -e 'select @@hostname, @@wsrep_node_name; select @@wsrep_node_name, @@hostname;'
+------------+-------------------+
| @@hostname | @@wsrep_node_name |
+------------+-------------------+
| db2        | db2               |
+------------+-------------------+
+-------------------+------------+
| @@wsrep_node_name | @@hostname |
+-------------------+------------+
| db3               | db3        |
+-------------------+------------+

In a single connection, fetching the values of the same two system variables results in the query being routed differently depending on the order of the variables.

Is there some set of variables that should always be routed to the master for some reason? If so, that should be documented.

Regardless, the order of terms in the SELECT list should not have any effect on query routing.

@@wsrep_node_name can be resolved only in backend, MaxScale doesn't know about it. As a consequence, Since MaxScale doesn't know what it is it takes the safe bet and routes it to master.

What do you mean by "resolved only in backend" and "MaxScale doesn't know about it"?

How is @@wsrep_node_name different in that respect from any other server variable that could be different on any given backend?

MaxScale doesn't know that there is such system variable as @@wsrep_node_name. In my understanding the reason is that the embedded MariaDB server doesn't have Galera's patch. Thus the variable is unknown.

Ahh, right. That sounds familiar. But it's still quite strange that the order of variables in the SELECT statement is meaningful, isn't it?

The effectiveness of atrribute order in SELECT clause is a bug which is fixed in http://bugs.skysql.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694 .

MaxScale's inability to detect different system variables is slightly problematic as well but haven't really concentrated on finding a decent solution to it yet. It might, however, be necessary.

Inability to detect Galera's system variables is hard to overcome since Galera patch doesn't work with embedded library and embedded library doesn't know Galera's system variables.
Comment 7 Vilho Raatikka 2015-01-17 09:38:09 UTC
Appeared that MariaDB parsing end result depends on the order of [known,unknown] system variable pair in the query.

There was similar-looking bug in query_classifier before which hide this one. However, debugging and examining the resulting thd and lex for the following queries shows that thd->free_list is non-empty if @@hostname (known variable) is before @@wsrep_node_name. If @@wsrep_node_name is first on the attribute list the resulting thd->free_list==NULL.
In the former case resulting query type is QUERY_TYPE_SYSVAR_READ (routed to slaves) and in the latter case it is unknown (routed to master).

1. select  @@wsrep_node_name, @@hostname;
2. select  @@hostname, @@wsrep_node_name;

Both queries produce similar response but routing them to master only limits scalability.
Comment 8 Mark Riddoch 2015-01-28 08:39:25 UTC
Raised this with the server team as the issue is related to the behaviour of the parser in the embedded server. System variables are resolved at parse time, unknown variables result in a parse error normally, however this order dependency is slightly puzzling.
Comment 9 Mark Riddoch 2015-02-13 10:06:08 UTC
Hi Sergei,

we have an interesting bug in MaxScale related to parsing. If we try to parse the query

select @@wsrep_node_name;

Using the embedded server we link with we do not get a parse tree. A select of other system variables works. I guess the parser is resolving the name of the variable rather than leaving it to the execution phase. Since we do not have Galera this variable is unknown. What is even more strange is that if we have a query of the form

select @@hostname, @@wsrep_node_name;

We do get a parse tree, but reversing the order of the select we again fail to get a parse tree with the query

select @@wsrep_node_name, @@hostname;

For our purposes we would ideally like to disable the resolving of the variable name at parse time, since that would give us flexibility with regard to new variables being introduced in the servers. Do you know if this is possible or if there is some easy fix we can do to the MariaDB parser that will help us here?

For your reference the MaxScale bug report can be found here http://bugs.skysql.com/show_bug.cgi?id=699


Thanks
Mark

Right... That would be *very* difficult to fix, it'd require a pretty
serious refactoring to get this out of the parser.

That depends on what you call a "parse tree". Items of the select clause
are stored in the thd->lex->current_select->item_list.

For the first query, the list have 1 element, Item_func_get_system_var
for @@hostname.

For the second query the list has 0 elements. In both cases, I've
examined the list in the debugger after MYSQLparse() returned.

So apparently the parsing as aborted as soon as unknown variable is
encountered.

I don't see how you can do that from MaxScale.
This looks like something that has to be fixed in the server.
Perhaps - not sure - it'd be possible to introduce some "mode" for the
parser where it doesn't check for valid variable names in certain
contextes.

Sergei
