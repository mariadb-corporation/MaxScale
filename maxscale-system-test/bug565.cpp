test for mysql_affected_rows() with/without CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS connection flag

Even worse: connections via maxscale always behave as if CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS is set even though the default is NOT having it set.

When doing the same update two times in a row without CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS
mysql_affected_rows() should return the number of rows actually changed
by the last query, while with CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS connection flag set the
number of matching rows is returned, even if the UPDATE didn't change
any column values.

With a direct connection to mysqld this works as expected,
through readconnroute(master) I'm always getting the number of matching
rows (as if CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS was set), and not the number of actually
changed rows when CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS is not set (which is the default
behaviour when not setting connection options)

Attaching PHP mysqli test script, result with direct mysqld connection is

  update #1: 2
  update #2: 0
  update #3: 2

while through maxscale it is

  update #1: 2
  update #2: 2
  update #3: 2

I also verified this using the C API directly to rule out that this is
a PHP specific problem

Client flags are not passed to backend server properly.

Pushed initial fix to MAX-311. Waiting for validation for the fix.
