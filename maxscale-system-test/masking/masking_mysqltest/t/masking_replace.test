# Masking Smoke
#
# We expect the masking rules to be as follows:
#
# {
#     "rules": [
#         {
#             "replace": {
#                 "column": "a"
#             },
#             "with": {
#                 "fill": "X"
#             }
#         },
#         {
#             "replace": {
#                 "column": "b"
#             },
#             "with": {
#                "value": "012345-ABCD"
#             }
#         },
#         {
#            "replace": {
#                 "column": "c"
#             },
#             "with": {
#                 "value": "012345-ABCD",
#                 "fill": "X"
#             }
#         }
#     ]
