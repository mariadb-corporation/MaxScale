 * @file bug495.cpp regression case for bug 495 ( Referring to a nonexisting server in servers=... doesn't even raise a warning )
 *
 * - Maxscale.cnf with "servers= server1, server2,server3  ,server4,server5"
 * but 'server5' is not defined. Test checks error log for proper error message.
 * - check if Maxscale is alive

Description Hartmut Holzgraefe 2014-08-31 21:32:09 UTC
Only [server1] and [server2] are defined,
service [test_service] and monitor [MySQL monitor]
refer to a third server "server3" in their servers=...
list though ...

Nothing in the err or msg log hints towards a problem ...
(which originally was caused by a copy/paste error that
also lead to the "duplicate section name" error reported
earlier ... and which would have been easy to track down
if either of these problems would at least have raised a
warning - took me almost an hour to track down the actual
problem ... :(
