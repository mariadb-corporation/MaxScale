Setting router_options=slave in readwritesplit causes:

in the error log

2013 11/22 10:35:43  Error : Couldn't find suitable Master from 3 candidates.
2013 11/22 10:35:43  Error : Failed to create router client session. Freeing allocated resources.


If no options are allowed here, it could be better to log this and/or unload the module


This is something could happen doing copy paste from readconnrouter as an example

I makes no sense for the read/write splitter to look at the slave and master router options.

Vilho Raatikka 2014-05-22 07:02:50 UTC
Added check for router option 'synced' which accepts only that, and warns the user of other unsupported options ('master'|'slave' for example). If router option is specified for read write split router, only a node in 'joined' state will be accepted as eligible backend candidate.
