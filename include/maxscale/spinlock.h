 * Spinlock implementation for MaxScale.
 *
 * Spinlocks are cheap locks that can be used to protect short code blocks, they are
 * generally wasteful as any blocked threads will spin, consuming CPU cycles, waiting
 * for the lock to be released. However they are useful in that they do not involve
 * system calls and are light weight when the expected wait time for a lock is low.

 * The spinlock structure.
 *
 * In normal builds the structure merely contains a lock value which
 * is 0 if the spinlock is not taken and greater than zero if it is held.
 *
 * In builds with the SPINLOCK_PROFILE option set this structure also holds
 * a number of profile related fields that count the number of spins, number
 * of waiting threads and the number of times the lock has been acquired.
