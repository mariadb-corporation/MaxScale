 * Spinlock implementation for MaxScale.
 *
 * Spinlocks are cheap locks that can be used to protect short code blocks, they are
 * generally wasteful as any blocked threads will spin, consuming CPU cycles, waiting
 * for the lock to be released. However they are useful in that they do not involve
 * system calls and are light weight when the expected wait time for a lock is low.
